4160-11549-0000 BUT BY THE END OF THE TWO WEEKS SHE GREW TIRED OF WAITING AND THE DAYS WERE SO VERY LONG THAT AT LENGTH NOT WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT COMPUNCTION SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO GO AND PAY A GUILELESS VISIT TO MISS PRISCILLA GOWER HERSELF

4160-11549-0004 ALBEIT THE FAT GRAY HORSES AND FAT GRAY COACHMAN DID OCCASIONALLY RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF THAT REMOTE LOCALITY
4160-11549-0005 AND IN HER PLEASURE AT SEEING HIM THAT YOUNG LADY FORGOT BOTH HERSELF AND SIR DUGALD AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD OH MISTER OGLETHORPE SHE CRIED OUT I AM SO GLAD AND THEN STOPPED IN A CONFUSION AND TREPIDATION ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT
4160-11549-0006 HE CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED IN AT HER ARE YOU COMING TO SEE PRISCILLA HE SAID LADY THROCKMORTON SAID I MIGHT SHE ANSWERED THE WARMTH IN HER FACE CHILLED BY HIS UNENTHUSIASTIC THOUGH KINDLY TONE SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT A STRUGGLE IT COST HIM TO FACE HER THUS CARELESSLY ALL AT ONCE

4160-11549-0008 BUT ON THIS OCCASION MISS ELIZABETH WAS NOT ARRAYED IN THE SNUFF COLORED SATIN AND WHEN THEY ENTERED PRISCILLA WAS KNEELING DOWN UPON THE HEARTH RUG STRAIGHTENING OUT AN OBSTREPEROUS FOLD IN IT SHE ROSE COLLECTEDLY AT ONCE AND AS HER FACE TURNED TOWARD THEM
4160-11549-0009 THEO WAS STRUCK WITH SOME FANCY OF ITS BEING A SHADE PALER THAN IT HAD BEEN THE LAST TIME SHE HAD SEEN IT BUT HER MANNER WAS NOT CHANGED IN THE LEAST AND SHE WELCOMED HER VISITOR WITH GRAVE CORDIALITY POOR LITTLE SNUFF COLORED MISS ELIZABETH WAS DELIGHTED

4160-11549-0012 AND THEO'S MODEST EULOGIES OF HER LAST PIECE OF WORK HAD WON HER ADMIRATION AND REGARD AT ONCE CONSEQUENTLY UNDER STRESS OF MISS ELIZABETH THE CARRIAGE WAS FAIN TO DEPART MUCH TO THE ABASEMENT OF THE FAT GRAY COACHMAN WHO FELT HIMSELF MUCH DISHONORED IN FINDING HE WAS COMPELLED
4160-11549-0013 NOT ONLY TO PAY MAJESTIC CALLS TO BROOME STREET BUT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HUMILIATING FACT OF FRIENDLY VISITS WE MUST HAVE A FIRE IN THE BEST PARLOR MY DEAR CHIRPED ELIZABETH ECSTATICALLY WHEN THEO'S HAT AND JACKET WERE BEING CARRIED OUT OF THE ROOM
4160-11549-0014 SHE WAS PARTICULARLY REMINDED OF IT BY THE CEREMONIOUS REPAIRING TO THE FIRE IN THE FRONT PARLOR WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SO ORDERLY AND EVEN THE FAMILY PORTRAITS HAD THE APPEARANCE OF FAMILY PORTRAITS ROUSED FROM A DEEP REVERIE TO BE SURPRISED AT AN INTRUSION
4160-11549-0015 MY LATE LAMENTED PARENTS MY DEAR SAID MISS ELIZABETH RUBBING HER SPECTACLES AND ADMIRINGLY REGARDING AN OWL LIKE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN IN AN AGGRESSIVE BROWN WIG AND AN EQUALLY OWL LIKE LADY IN A SELF ANNOUNCING FALSE FRONT EMBARRASSINGLY SUGGESTIVE OF MISS ELIZABETH'S OWN

4160-11549-0017 SHE HAD A PALE HANDSOME UNGIRLISH FACE A MINERVA FACE STEADY GRAVE HANDSOME EYES AND A FINE HEAD UNADORNED SAVE WITH A CLASSIC KNOT OF BLACK BROWN HAIR THE PICTURE WAS NOT EVEN YOUNGER LOOKING THAN PRISCILLA WAS NOW
4160-11549-0018 MISS ELIZABETH REGARDED IT IN AFFECTIONATE ADMIRATION OF ITS BEAUTY MY DEAR SHE SAID TO THEODORA THAT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FACE IN LONDON TO MY OLD EYES IT REMINDS ME OF MY DEAR ANASTASIA IN HER YOUTH I WAS ALWAYS GLAD MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S DAUGHTER WAS NOT LIKE HIS WIFE
4160-11549-0019 WE WERE NOT FOND OF MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WIFE SHE WAS A VERY GIDDY YOUNG PERSON AND VERY FOND OF GAYETY SHE DIED OF LUNG FEVER CONTRACTED THROUGH EXPOSING HERSELF ONE NIGHT AT A MILITARY BALL IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO MY BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WISHES
4160-11549-0020 SHE INSISTED UPON WEARING BLUE SATIN SLIPPERS AND A LOW NECKED DRESS OH DEAR SAID THEODORA SECRETLY CONSCIOUS OF A GUILTY SYMPATHY FOR THE GIDDY YOUNG PERSON WHO RAN COUNTER TO BROTHER BENJAMIN'S WISHES IN THE MATTER OF MILITARY BALLS AND BLUE SATIN SLIPPERS
4160-11549-0021 YES MY LOVE MISS ELIZABETH PROCEEDED AND FOR THAT REASON I WAS ALWAYS GLAD TO FIND THAT PRISCILLA WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HER PRISCILLA AND I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TOGETHER IN OUR QUIET WAY SHE HAS BEEN THE BEST OF DEAR GOOD GIRLS TO ME
4160-11549-0022 INDEED I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO WHEN I MUST LOSE HER AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO WHEN SHE MARRIES MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE YES MA'AM ANSWERED THEO AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELT A CURIOUS STARTLED GLOW FLASH OVER HER
4160-11549-0023 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME AN ACTUAL APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT HAD BEEN MADE IN HER PRESENCE YES MY DEAR SAID MISS ELIZABETH AGAIN I SHALL FEEL THE SEPARATION VERY DEEPLY BUT IT MUST BE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR EACH OTHER THAT I SHOULD BE A VERY WICKED SELFISH OLD WOMAN TO THROW ANY OBSTACLE
4160-11549-0024 EULOGIZING PRISCILLA AND HER BETROTHED AFFECTIONATELY MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WOULD BE A RICH MAN SOME OF THESE DAYS AND THEN WHAT A HAPPY LIFE MUST PRISCILLA'S BE SO YOUNG SO BEAUTIFUL SO BELOVED NOT THAT WEALTH BRINGS HAPPINESS MY DEAR MISS THEODORA
4160-11549-0025 RICHES ARE VERY DECEITFUL YOU KNOW BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOLID COMFORT IN A GENTEEL SUFFICIENCY TO ALL OF WHICH THEO ACQUIESCED MODESTLY INWARDLY WONDERING IF SHE WAS VERY WRONG IN WISHING THAT OGLETHORPE HAD NOT LEFT THEM QUITE SO EARLY
4160-11549-0026 THE DAY PASSED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH HOWEVER IN A QUIET WAY MISS ELIZABETH WAS VERY AFFECTIONATE AND COMMUNICATIVE AND TOLD HER A GREAT MANY STORIES OF ANASTASIA AND THE LATE LAMENTED BENJAMIN AS THEY SAT BY THE FIRE TOGETHER IN THE EVENING AND BLUNDERED OVER THE OCTAGON STITCH
4160-11549-0027 IT WAS AN AFGHAN MISS ELIZABETH WAS MAKING NOW AND WHEN AT TEA TIME MISTER OGLETHORPE CAME HE FOUND THEODORA NORTH SITTING ON THE HEARTH FLUSHED WITH INDUSTRIOUS ANXIETY AND THROWN INTO REFLECTED GLOW OF BRILLIANT BERLIN WOOL A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG SPIDER IN A GORGEOUS AFGHAN WEB
4160-11549-0028 HER LETTERS WERE NEVER CARELESS OR BEHIND TIME AND NO ONE WAS EVER NEGLECTED IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF MESSAGES SHE WOULD BE THE MOST TRUTHFUL AND FAITHFUL OF LOVING WOMEN A FEW YEARS HENCE THIS HANDSOME THEODORA THERE WAS SOME RESERVE IN HER MANNER TOWARD DENIS THIS EVENING
4160-11549-0029 SHE ATTENDED TO MISS ELIZABETH'S OCTAGON STITCH AND LEFT HIM TO AMUSE PRISCILLA HE HAD NOT SEEMED VERY MUCH PLEASED TO SEE HER IN THE MORNING AND BESIDES PRISCILLA WAS PLAINLY HIS BUSINESS BUT WHEN THE CARRIAGE WAS ANNOUNCED AND SHE RETURNED TO THE PARLOR AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A FEW MINUTES
4160-11549-0030 DRAWING ON HER GLOVES AND BUTTONING HER PRETTY JACKET CLOSE UP TO HER BEAUTIFUL SLENDER DUSKY THROAT DENIS TOOK HIS HAT AND ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE FOOTMAN THIS TIME BUT AFTER ASSISTING HER TO GET IN CLOSED THE DOOR HIMSELF
4160-11549-0031 AND NOTHING ON EARTH COULD PREVENT IT BUSINESS HAS UNEXPECTEDLY CALLED ME AWAY FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND HE EXPLAINED IN A STRANGE YET QUITE STEADY VOICE I AM OBLIGED TO GO TO BELGIUM AT ONCE
4160-11549-0032 AND MY AFFAIRS ARE IN SUCH A CONDITION THAT I MAY BE COMPELLED TO REMAIN ACROSS THE CHANNEL FOR SOME TIME BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY TO LADY THROCKMORTON THAT I REGRET DEEPLY THAT I COULD NOT SEE HER BEFORE GOING BUT BUT THE NEWS HAS BEEN SUDDEN AND MY TIME IS FULLY OCCUPIED
4160-11549-0033 BUT I WILL WRITE TO HER FROM MY FIRST STOPPING PLACE I WILL TELL HER SAID THEODORA THANK YOU HE REPLIED COURTEOUSLY AND THEN AFTER A SHORT HESITATION BEGAN AGAIN IN THE TONE HE USED SO OFTEN THE TONE THAT MIGHT BE JEST OR EARNEST
4160-11549-0034 AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE A SUBJECT UPON WHICH I WISH TO ASK YOUR UNBIASED OPINION MY DEAR THEODORA BEFORE I SAY GOOD BYE WHEN A MAN FINDS HIMSELF IN A DANGER WITH WHICH HE CANNOT COMBAT AND REMAIN HUMAN
4160-11549-0035 IN DANGER WHERE DEFEAT MEANS DISHONOR DO YOU NOT AGREE WITH ME THAT THE SAFEST PLAN THAT MAN CAN ADOPT IS TO RUN AWAY HER QUICKENED HEART MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN RUNNING A LIFE AND DEATH RACE WITH HER LEAPING PULSE BUT SHE ANSWERED HIM ALMOST STEADILY
4160-11549-0036 THIS MORNING WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOW YOU BEGAN TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BEING GLAD WERE YOU GOING TO SAY HE BROKE OFF HERE SHARPLY NO HE EXCLAIMED I WILL NOT ASK YOU I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU THEO INTERRUPTED GRAVELY
4160-11549-0037 I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU AND NOW PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER TELL THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE ON I WILL DELIVER YOUR MESSAGE TO LADY THROCKMORTON AND AS I SHALL NOT SEE YOU AGAIN UNLESS I AM HERE IN JULY OF COURSE YOU WILL COME BACK THEN GOOD BYE MISTER OGLETHORPE
4160-11549-0038 SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOW AND FOR A MOMENT HE HELD IT TO ALL APPEARANCE QUITE CALM AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE LOVELY FACE THE FLARE OF AN ADJACENT GASLIGHT REVEALED TO HIM AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF SHADOW
