5390-24512-0000 FOR ALTHOUGH THE JEWISH FAMILY OF THE HERODS REIGNED OVER JUDEA THEY ONLY HELD THEIR THRONE UNDER THE ROMAN EMPEROR THIS THE JEWS COULD NOT ENDURE THEY LONGED TO BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION ONCE AGAIN
5390-24512-0001 WHEN OUR MESSIAH COMES HE WILL BE A GREAT WARRIOR THEY SAID HE WILL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL OUR ENEMIES HE WILL MAKE JERUSALEM THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY
5390-24512-0002 HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
5390-24512-0003 THE SAVIOUR SOUGHT TO HEAL IT HE CALLED OUT THE FAITH AND GRATITUDE OF THE ROMAN CENTURION AND HIS ANSWER TO THE JEWISH LEADERS RENDER TO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE CAESAR'S
5390-24512-0004 SHOWED THEM THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WHICH TO REGARD THE ROMAN RULE
5390-24512-0005 THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
5390-24512-0006 HAD NOT THE JEWS PREVENTED IT IF THOU LET THIS MAN GO THOU ART NOT CAESAR'S FRIEND THEY CRIED
5390-24512-0007 TO CRUCIFY JESUS OF NAZARETH AND TO FREE BARABBAS BUT IN CHOOSING THE REBEL BARABBAS
5390-24512-0008 AS THEIR HERO THE NATION STARTED ON THEIR DOWNWARD ROAD AS THE STORY OF THE FORTY YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SAVIOUR'S CRUCIFIXION CLEARLY SHOWS FOR THE JEWS WERE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO THROW OFF THE ROMAN YOKE
5390-24512-0009 AND THE HISTORY OF THOSE YEARS IS ONE LONG LIST OF TERRIBLE RISINGS AND MASSACRES WHILE CITIES WERE RUINED VILLAGES WRAPPED IN FLAMES AND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN PERISHED WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0010 YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0011 THEN IF ANY MAN SHALL SAY UNTO YOU LO HERE IS CHRIST OR THERE BELIEVE IT NOT MATTHEW
5390-24512-0012 YET NO SOONER DID A DARING REBEL OR MURDERER GATHER A BAND OF ROBBERS AROUND HIM AND BEGIN TO KILL AND PLUNDER THAN MULTITUDES OF JEWS CRIED THE CHRIST OR MESSIAH HAS COME
5390-24512-0013 WHERE THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE QUARTERED AND CRIED OUT TO THE GARRISON WITHIN THAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE SPARED IF THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS HESITATED BUT THE JEWS PROMISED MOST FAITHFULLY TO KEEP THEIR WORD
5390-24512-0014 THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
5390-24512-0015 LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AS THOUGH CALLING UPON GOD TO WITNESS THAT THE JEWS HAD BROKEN THEIR SOLEMN OATH THE ROMAN EMPEROR COULD NOT OVERLOOK SUCH REBELLION AND TREACHERY
5390-24512-0016 AND HE SENT A GREAT ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM THE JEWS SHUT THE GATES OF THEIR CITY AND SO BEGAN THE AWFUL SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN YE SHALL SEE JERUSALEM COMPASSED WITH ARMIES
5390-24512-0017 HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0018 AS ONE BY ONE THEIR DEFENCES FELL AND THE END DREW NEAR THEN FOOD FAILED IN THE CITY MEN FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS IN THE STREETS FOR A TINY LOAF OF BARLEY BREAD SO FRANTIC WERE THE PEOPLE WITH HUNGER
5390-24512-0019 THAT MOTHERS EVEN SNATCHED THE BREAD FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S MOUTHS LOOK OVER THE WALLS O PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIFYING ALL THE PRISONERS THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THE LINE OF CROSSES IS AS LONG AS OUR CITY IS WIDE
5390-24512-0020 HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
5390-24512-0021 BUT A FURIOUS MADNESS HAD POSSESSED THE PEOPLE AND THEY REFUSED TO YIELD JOSEPHUS PLEADED IN VAIN HE WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN BUT HE COULD SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT GOD WAS NO LONGER WITH HIS PEOPLE
5390-24512-0022 AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
5390-24512-0023 EVEN A JEW WHO HAD NO FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THE ANCIENT POWER AND GLORY OF HIS NATION HAD GONE AT LAST THE END CAME THE FIRST WALL FELL
5390-24512-0024 WHICH STILL GLITTERED LIKE A HILL OF SNOW IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR SPARKLED AS THOUGH WRAPPED IN FLAME WHEN THE SUNBEAMS STRUCK FULL ON ITS GOLDEN ROOF THEN REDDER FLAMES THAN EVER THE SUNSHINE MADE LEAPT ABOVE THE GOLDEN ROOF
5390-24512-0025 PILLARS FELL BEAMS CRUMBLED TO ASHES WHILE ROUND THE ALTAR OF SACRIFICE THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM LAY HEAPED TOGETHER SLAIN IN SUCH NUMBERS IN THE HOLY PLACE THAT THEIR BLOOD FLOWED DOWN THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS IN A HEAVY CRIMSON STREAM
5390-24512-0026 AND THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW WERE CARRIED AWAY IN TRIUMPH INTO HEATHEN ROME ALAS FOR THE HOLY CITY OVER WHICH THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD STOOD AND WEPT FORTY YEARS BEFORE
5390-24512-0027 KNOWING THE SUFFERING THAT LAY BEFORE HER THESE JEWS ARE DANGEROUS WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD THEIR CITY OR TO BECOME A SEPARATE PEOPLE AGAIN AS A NATION THEY MUST CEASE TO EXIST
5390-24512-0028 SO THE ROMAN CONQUERORS OF JERUSALEM AGREED AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARD THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE INDEED BEEN LED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ALL NATIONS
5390-24512-0029 EXACTLY AS THE LORD FORETOLD THERE IS SCARCELY A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE JEWS MAY NOT BE FOUND BUT JERUSALEM LIES STILL IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE TURKISH NATION
5390-24512-0030 THE JEWS WERE NOW NO LONGER A NATION THEY HAD BECOME MERELY A BODY OF PEOPLE LED BY THEIR RABBIS OR TEACHERS OF THE LAW BUT THEY WERE STILL THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK
5390-24512-0031 THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
5390-24512-0032 OVER WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD SAILED SO OFTEN AND BESIDE WHOSE SHORES HE HAD DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL DEEDS OF LOVE AND MERCY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE IT WAS WITH BROAD TERRACED GARDENS
5390-24512-0033 SO ALL DAY LONG THEY STUDIED AND COPIED THE OLD HEBREW BIBLE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE JEWISH SCRIBES HAD NOT BEEN CONTENT WITH TAKING THE WORD OF GOD JUST AS IT STOOD THEY HAD BEGUN EVEN IN OUR LORD'S DAY
5390-24512-0034 THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
5390-24512-0035 YET ALTHOUGH THEY HEEDED SO LITTLE THE TRUE MEANING OF GOD'S BOOK THEY GUARDED ITS WORDS MORE AND MORE CAREFULLY AND THE RULES FOR COPYING ANY PORTION OF THE HOLY BOOKS WERE STRICT INDEED MY SON AN OLD TEACHER WOULD SAY TO HIS PUPIL
5390-24512-0036 BEFORE YOU COPY A SINGLE WORD YOU MUST WASH YOUR BODY ALL OVER AND CLOTHE YOURSELF IN FULL JEWISH DRESS PREPARING YOUR MIND WITH SOLEMN THOUGHTS THE PARCHMENT YOU WRITE UPON MUST BE MADE FROM THE SKINS OF CLEAN ANIMALS ONLY
5390-24512-0037 THAT IS CLEAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE INK YOU WRITE WITH MUST BE OF A PURE BLACK MADE ONLY FROM A MIXTURE OF SOOT CHARCOAL AND HONEY
5390-24512-0038 THOUGH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BOOK OF THE LAW BY HEART YOU MUST NOT WRITE A SINGLE WORD FROM MEMORY BUT RAISE YOUR EYES TO YOUR COPY AND PRONOUNCE THE WORD ALOUD BEFORE TRUSTING IT TO YOUR PEN
5390-24512-0039 BEFORE WRITING ANY OF THE NAMES OF GOD YOU MUST WASH YOUR PEN BEFORE WRITING HIS MOST SACRED NAME YOU MUST WASH YOUR WHOLE BODY IF AFTER YOUR COPY HAS ITSELF BEEN EXAMINED THREE CORRECTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE
5390-24512-0040 THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
5390-24512-0041 IS THE MIDDLE LETTER OF ALL THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES
5390-24512-0042 IS THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE WORDS
5390-24512-0043 IS THE VERY CENTRE OF ALL THE VERSES THE LETTER A THAT IS THE HEBREW LETTER WHICH STANDS FOR A OCCURS FORTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES THE LETTER B THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
5390-24512-0044 AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-24512-0045 AND THE BREADTH OF EACH COLUMN HAD TO BE THIRTY LETTERS WIDE THERE ARE ELEVEN VERSES IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW BEGINNING AND ENDING WITH N THERE ARE FORTY VERSES IN WHICH LO IS READ THREE TIMES AND SO ON AND SO ON
5390-24512-0046 HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
5390-24512-0047 NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD GOD REVEALED HIS WILL TO MAN SOME YEARS AGO IN THE COFFIN OF AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY A LITTLE JAR OF WHEAT WAS FOUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT HAD LAIN THERE SHUT UP IN THE DARK
5390-24512-0048 WHILE OUT IN THE FIELDS THE CORN WHICH HAD BEEN SOWN HAD GROWN UP AND BEEN REAPED EVERY YEAR AND MEN AND WOMEN HAD BEEN FED BUT THIS JAR OF CORN WAS USELESS BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM DOING THE WORK IN THE WORLD FOR WHICH IT WAS CREATED
5390-24512-0049 JUST SO WAS IT WITH THE HEBREW COPIES OF GOD'S WORD LOCKED UP IN A DEAD LANGUAGE KEPT CLOSE AWAY FROM THE WORLD THEY WERE LIKE THE JAR OF WHEAT WHICH COULD NOT GROW
