3235-28452-0000 ON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JUNE I AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE ICE HAD DRIFTED OUT TO SEA IN THE NIGHT EIGHT DAYS AFTER MOLLIE AND I HAD TAKEN OUR TWELVE MILES TRIP ACROSS THE BAY AND RETURN
3235-28452-0001 THEN CAME HARD RAIN AND WIND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BLEW THE ICE BACK INTO THE BAY FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE STEAMERS WAITING TO COME IN COULD NOT DO SO FOR FEAR OF THE DRIFTING FLOES
3235-28452-0002 BY THE THIRTIETH OF JUNE SCHOONERS WERE COMING INTO THE BAY WITH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT AND THE COAST STEAMERS ELMORE AND DORA HAD BEGUN TO MAKE REGULAR TRIPS TO AND FROM NOME WITH THEM CAME MAILS FROM THE OUTSIDE
3235-28452-0003 WITH NEWSPAPERS AND TIDINGS OF FRIENDS IN THE STATES THEN OUR FINGERS TREMBLED AT OPENING OUR LETTERS UNTIL WE FOUND THAT ALL OUR DEAR ONES WERE WELL AND WE HEARTILY THANKED THE LORD

3235-28452-0005 SLEEPING DURING THE DAY AND GUARDING THE HOUSE NIGHTS THE HEAVY IRON BRACELETS IN HIS INNER COAT POCKET WEIGHING SCARCELY MORE THAN THE LOADED REVOLVER IN HIS BELT
3235-28452-0006 OUR LITTLE SICK GIRL BEING OBLIGED NOW TO KEEP HER BED CONTINUALLY WITH NO MORE PLAYING IN THE SAND AND SUNSHINE ALTHOUGH HER COUGH HAD LEFT HER WAS STILL THE SAME SWEET PATIENT CHILD SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL HER ILLNESS
3235-28452-0007 AND MY WHOLE TIME WAS GIVEN TO HER BEFORE ONE OF THE SUNNY SOUTH WINDOWS OF THE LIVING ROOM WE PLACED HER COT EACH MORNING AND HERE SHE RECEIVED HER NUMEROUS FRIENDS BOTH ESKIMO AND WHITE AND THEIR NAMES WERE LEGION
3235-28452-0008 THEY CAME FROM THE EAST WEST NORTH AND SOUTH ALL SORRY TO KNOW OF HER ILLNESS AND BRINGING PRESENTS WITH THEM SOMETIMES IT WAS A LITTLE LIVE BIRD OR SQUIRREL A DELICIOUS SALMON TROUT

3235-28452-0011 FOR A FISH BIRD ANIMAL OR BABY SHOWING PLAINLY HER TASTE FOR THE THINGS OF NATURE IN PREFERENCE TO ART HER LOVE FOR HER BIRTHPLACE WITH ITS HILLS STREAMS AND OCEAN IS A SINCERE ONE
3235-28452-0012 AND YOUNG AS SHE IS AND HAVING SEEN THE GREAT CITY BY THE GOLDEN GATE WITH MANY OF ITS WONDERS SHE IS HAPPIEST IN CHINIK HERE LIVES HER DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER HER COUSINS AND AUNTS
3235-28452-0013 FOR WHICH SHE HAS A WHOLE HEARTFUL OF LOVE AND THE SIGHT OF WHICH IS BETTER TO HER THAN MEDICINE DURING THE MONTH OF JULY WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE INCOMING STEAMERS AND WELCOMED ALL NEW COMERS WHO LANDED IN CHINIK
3235-28452-0014 MANY WERE SIMPLY PASSING THROUGH ON THEIR WAY UP FISH RIVER TO THE MINES
3235-28452-0015 A FEW REMAINED FOR THE SUMMER HERE MEN BUILT BOATS AND ROWED AWAY TO KEECHAWIK AND NEUKLUK CARRYING SUPPLIES FOR HUNTING OR PROSPECTING THE CAPTAIN'S VEGETABLE GARDEN IN THE SAND WAS GROWING RAPIDLY
3235-28452-0016 AND WAS WATCHED WITH EAGER EYES BY EVERYONE WE ATE LETTUCE AND RADISHES PICKED FRESH FROM THE GARDEN BEDS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BY THE CAPTAIN'S OWN HANDS AND WE FOUND AGEETUK AND MOLLIE TO BE QUITE FAMOUS COOKS

3235-28452-0019 AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH MY GOLD CLAIMS WERE WITH
3235-28452-0020 ARRANGED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN I BOARDED THE STEAMER I WOULD CARRY WITH ME AT LEAST THREE DEEDS TO AS MANY CLAIMS WITH A FAIR PROSPECT OF OTHERS BUT I COULD NOT DECIDE TO REMAIN ANOTHER WINTER
3235-28452-0021 I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO SAINT MICHAEL UP THE YUKON TO DAWSON AND OUTSIDE AND LAID MY PLANS ACCORDINGLY
3235-28452-0022 THE LATTER NOW GROWN WILFUL BUT STILL SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY I WANTED TO TAKE BOTH WITH ME BUT NO I COULD NOT THE LITTLE GIRL'S WORK WAS NOT ENDED
3235-28452-0023 AND SHE IS SURELY ABOUT TO FULFILL IT BORN AS SHE WAS IN A ROUGH MINING CAMP AT THE FOOT OF THE BARREN HILLS SHE WAS GIVEN THE ESKIMO NAME OF YAHKUK MEANING A LITTLE HILL
3235-28452-0024 AND SHE LIKE AN OASIS IN A DESERT PLACE IS LEFT HERE TO CHEER LOVE AND HELP OTHERS MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF THE SWEET AND GENTLE INFLUENCES GOING OUT FROM THE LIFE OF LITTLE YAHKUK
3235-28452-0025 AS SHE LIES UPON HER COT OF PAIN A TALL BROWN MINER ENTERS THE LIVING ROOM GOES TO THE LITTLE BED BY THE WINDOW SPEAKS SOFTLY AND BENDING OVER THE TINY GIRL KISSES HER
3235-28452-0026 THEN HER BIG BLACK EYES GLANCE BRIGHTLY INTO BLUE ONES LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE FULL RED LIPS PART IN A CORDIAL SMILE WHILE THE ONE SOLITARY DIMPLE IN THE SMOOTH ROUND CHEEK
3235-28452-0027 PRICKS ITS WAY STILL DEEPER AND SMALL ARMS GO UP AROUND HIS NECK WHEN THE MAN TURNS HIS FACE WEARS A SOFT AND TENDER EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE WERE LOOKING AT SOME BEAUTIFUL SIGHT FAR AWAY
3235-28452-0028 AND PERHAPS HE IS GOD GRANT THAT THE SWEET MEMORY OF THAT LITTLE CHILD'S KISS MAY BE SO LASTING THAT ALL THEIR LIVES HE AND OTHERS MAY BE PURER AND BETTER MEN
3235-28452-0029 WHEN AUGUST CAME I SAILED AWAY THE DORA HAD ENTERED THE BAY IN THE MORNING AND FOUND MY TRUNK PACKED AND WAITING IT WAS THEN ONLY THE WORK OF A LITTLE TIME TO MAKE READY TO LEAVE
3235-28452-0030 TO MY GOOD MISSIONARY FRIENDS I HAD ALREADY SAID GOOD BYE AND THE CAPTAIN AND MOLLIE WERE KINDLY REGRETFUL WITH TEARS IN MY EYES BUT WITH REAL PAIN IN MY HEART I BADE JENNIE GOOD BYE
