3242-8112-0000 MANTELISH EXCUSED HIMSELF AND WENT OFF WITH THE MESSENGER THE DOOR CLOSED QUILLAN CAME BACK TO HIS CHAIR WE'RE MOVING THE OUTFIT LATER TONIGHT THE COMMISSIONER EXPLAINED
3242-8112-0001 EIGHT TONS OF HIS LAB EQUIPMENT PLUS HIS SPECIAL U LEAGUE GUARDS OH TRIGGER PICKED UP THE PUYA GLASS SHE LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS EMPTY MOVING WHERE SHE ASKED MANON SAID THE COMMISSIONER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER
3242-8112-0002 EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
3242-8112-0003 THEN SHE SMILED AT QUILLAN MAJOR SHE SAID HOW ABOUT A TINY LITTLE REFILL ON THAT PUYA ABOUT HALF QUILLAN TOOK CARE OF THE TINY LITTLE REFILL COMMISSIONER TATE SAID BY THE WAY
3242-8112-0004 QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
3242-8112-0005 AND NOW SAID THE COMMISSIONER WE'LL TALK MORE FREELY WE TELL MANTELISH JUST AS LITTLE AS WE CAN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH TRIGGER THE PROFESSOR IS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP ON AN OPERATION LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S YES SHE SAID
3242-8112-0006 GOING OVER FOR VISITS TO MANTELISH'S GARDEN WITH MY FATHER IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I REMEMBER I CAN IMAGINE HE'S A PROBLEM SHE SHIFTED HER GAZE CURIOUSLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THE TWO MEN WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING
3242-8112-0007 LOOKING FOR GESS FAYLE AND THE KEY UNIT HOLATI TATE SAID THAT'S ABOUT IT WE'RE ONE OF A FEW THOUSAND FEDERATION GROUPS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME GENERAL JOB EACH GROUP WORKS AT ITS SPECIALTIES AND THE INFORMATION GETS CORRELATED
3242-8112-0008 IN WHAT WAY TRIGGER ASKED WELL SUPPOSE THAT KEY UNIT IS LOST AND STAYS LOST SUPPOSE ALL THE OTHER PLASMOIDS PUT TOGETHER DON'T CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SHOW HOW THE OLD GALACTICS PRODUCED THE THINGS AND GOT THEM TO OPERATE
3242-8112-0009 SOMEBODY WOULD GET THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY SOON WOULDN'T THEY
3242-8112-0010 THERE SEEM TO BE TOO MANY BASIC FACTORS MISSING IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF SCIENCES FIRST AND THAT COULD TAKE A FEW CENTURIES WELL TRIGGER ADMITTED I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE THINGS INDEFINITELY
3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
3242-8112-0012 AND THE NUMBER OF PLANETARY CONFEDERACIES SUBPLANETARY GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRIAL FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL COMBINES ASSORTED POWER GROUPS ET CETERA AND SO ON IS SOMETHING I'D HATE TO HAVE TO CALCULATE WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE ASKED
3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0014 OF COURSE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET VERY UNHAPPY EH THAT SAID COMMISSIONER TATE IS ONLY A LITTLE OF IT YES THE THING ISN'T JUST LOST SOMEBODY'S GOT IT VERY LIKELY TRIGGER NODDED
3242-8112-0015 SO ANY ONE OF UMPTEEN THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE HUB MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT HAS THAT PLASMOID NOW INCLUDING SAID HOLATI ANY ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN RESTRICTED WORLDS
3242-8112-0016 THEIR TREATIES OF LIMITATION WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM GET INTO THE PLASMOID PIE UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AT IT A DECADE OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EAGER THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN TRIGGER SAID LORDY
3242-8112-0017 THE THING COULD EVEN SET OFF ANOTHER STRING OF WARS THAT'S A POINT THE COUNCIL IS NERVOUS ABOUT HE SAID WELL IT CERTAINLY IS A MESS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE FEDERATION MIGHT HAVE HAD A SECURITY CHIEF IN ON THAT FIRST OPERATION
3242-8112-0018 RIGHT THERE ON HARVEST MOON THEY DID HE SAID IT WAS FAYLE
3242-8112-0019 HOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOO
3242-8112-0020 I'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESS
3242-8112-0021 AND WE KNOW DEFINITELY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE GAMBLING FOR IT HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE OF LEADS HERE PRETTY SHORT LEADS SO FAR BUT YOU WORK WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET HE NODDED AT THE TABLE
3242-8112-0022 TRIGGER GLANCED DOWN THE PLASMOID LAY THERE SOME INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF HER HAND YOU KNOW SHE SAID UNCOMFORTABLY OLD REPULSIVE MOVED AGAIN WHILE WE WERE TALKING TOWARDS MY HAND SHE DREW THE HAND AWAY
3242-8112-0023 I WAS WATCHING IT MAJOR QUILLAN SAID REASSURINGLY FROM THE END OF THE TABLE
3242-8112-0024 MANTELISH BROUGHT IT BACK TO MACCADON WITH HIM
3242-8112-0025 HE WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS AT WHAT ITS FUNCTION WAS IT WAS JUST LYING THERE IN A CUBICLE SO HE DID CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT WHILE HE WAITED FOR GESS FAYLE TO SHOW UP
3242-8112-0026 AND LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS FIDGETED AROUND HOPING TO GET THE KIND OF REPORT FROM MANTELISH AND FAYLE THAT MANTELISH THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED THEY WERE WONDERING WHERE FAYLE WAS TOO BUT THEY KNEW FAYLE WAS SECURITY SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO GET TOO NOSY
3242-8112-0027 TRIGGER SHOOK HER HEAD WONDERFUL SO
3242-8112-0028 MANTELISH BEGAN TO GET RESULTS WITH IT THE COMMISSIONER SAID ONE EXPERIMENT WAS RATHER STARTLING HE'D BEEN TRYING THAT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION BUSINESS NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED THEN HE TOUCHED THE PLASMOID AND IT FED THE WHOLE CHARGE BACK TO HIM
3242-8112-0029 SHE LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY GOOD FOR REPULSIVE STOOD UP FOR HIS RIGHTS EH MANTELISH GAINED SOME SUCH IMPRESSION ANYWAY HE BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THEN HE LEARNED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT
3242-8112-0030 HE WAS VISITING ANOTHER LAB WHERE THEY HAD A COUPLE OF PLASMOIDS WHICH ACTUALLY MOVED NOW AND THEN
3242-8112-0031 THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
3242-8112-0032 RIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOID
3242-8112-0033 THE BIG ONE INDUCES PLASMOID ACTIVITY THE LITTLE ONE MODIFIES IT
3242-8112-0034 BUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS A CERTAINTY BY THEN AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FEDS GOT THERE FAST AND DEAD BRAINED THE RAIDER THEY LEARNED JUST TWO THINGS
3242-8112-0035 ONE HE'D BEEN MIND BLOCKED AND COULDN'T HAVE SPILLED ANY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION EVEN IF THEY HAD GOT HIM ALIVE THE OTHER ITEM THEY DREW FROM HIS BRAIN WAS A CLEAR IMPRESSION OF THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE PROFESSOR'S PAL HERE UH HUH TRIGGER SAID LOST IN THOUGHT
3242-8112-0036 SHE POKED REPULSIVE LIGHTLY THAT WOULD BE FAYLE AND HIS ASSOCIATES THEN OR SOMEBODY WHO KNEW ABOUT THEM DID THEY WANT TO KILL IT OR GRAB IT THE COMMISSIONER LOOKED AT HER GRAB IT WAS THE DEAD BRAIN REPORT WHY
3242-8112-0037 SO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORK
3242-8112-0038 MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
3242-8112-0039 SO TRIGGER SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE TWO THIRDS OF WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE THIRD RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE HOW MANY OF THE LATER RAIDERS DID YOU CATCH ALL OF THEM SAID THE COMMISSIONER AROUND FORTY
3242-8112-0040 WE GOT THEM DEAD WE GOT THEM ALIVE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THEY WERE HIRED HANDS VERY EXPENSIVE HIRED HANDS BUT STILL JUST THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW A THING WE COULD USE THE ONES THAT DID KNOW SOMETHING WERE MIND BLOCKED AGAIN
3242-8112-0041 I THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING
3242-8112-0042 THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN TRIGGER ASKED HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS PERSONALLY MORE OR LESS BY ACCIDENT THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECOND LEAD THAT'S ME HUH SHE SAID UNHAPPILY YES
3242-8112-0043 WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT
3242-8112-0044 I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONER
