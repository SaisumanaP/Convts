4088-158077-0000 THE WAR MESSAGE CONCLUDED WITH STILL ANOTHER DEFENSE OF THE FIGHT FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY TO SUCH A TASK WE CAN DEDICATE OUR LIVES AND OUR FORTUNES EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE WITH THE PRIDE OF THOSE WHO KNOW
4088-158077-0001 WE WERE FACE TO FACE WITH THE QUESTION WHICH WE HAD CONSIDERED AT THE CONVENTION THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHEN WAR WAS RUMORED AS TO WHAT POSITION WE AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD TAKE IN THIS SITUATION THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CONVENTION HAD BEEN DRAMATIC IN THE EXTREME
4088-158077-0002 MOST OF THE DELEGATES ASSEMBLED HAD BEEN APPROACHED EITHER BEFORE GOING TO WASHINGTON OR UPON ARRIVING AND URGED TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PERSUADE THE ORGANIZATION TO ABANDON ITS WORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN AND TURN ITS ACTIVITIES INTO WAR CHANNELS
4088-158077-0003 ALTHOUGH WAR WAS THEN ONLY RUMORED THE HYSTERICAL ATTITUDE WAS ALREADY PREVALENT WOMEN WERE ASKED TO FURL THEIR BANNERS AND GIVE UP THEIR HALF CENTURY STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY TO FORGET THE LIBERTY THAT WAS MOST PRECIOUS TO THEIR HEARTS
4088-158077-0004 THE PRESIDENT WILL TURN THIS IMPERIALISTIC WAR INTO A CRUSADE FOR DEMOCRACY LAY ASIDE YOUR OWN FIGHT AND HELP US CRUSH GERMANY AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELVES REWARDED WITH A VOTE OUT OF THE NATION'S GRATITUDE WERE SOME OF THE APPEALS MADE TO OUR WOMEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HIGH AND LOW
4088-158077-0005 AND BY THE RANK AND FILE OF MEN AND WOMEN NEVER IN HISTORY DID A BAND OF WOMEN STAND TOGETHER WITH MORE SANITY AND GREATER SOLIDARITY THAN DID THESE ONE THOUSAND DELEGATES REPRESENTING THOUSANDS MORE THROUGHOUT THE STATES AS OUR OFFICIAL ORGAN THE SUFFRAGIST
4088-158077-0006 POINTED OUT EDITORIALLY IN ITS ISSUE OF APRIL TWENTY FIRST NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
4088-158077-0007 WE WERE UNITED ON NO OTHER SUBJECT SOME WOULD OFFER PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO THE WAR OTHERS WOULD BECOME DEVOTED FOLLOWERS OF A VIGOROUS MILITARY POLICY BETWEEN THESE EVERY SHADE OF OPINION WAS REPRESENTED EACH WAS LOYAL TO THE IDEAS WHICH SHE HELD FOR HER COUNTRY
4088-158077-0008 HAD NOTHING TO DO IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOR WOMEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION THROUGH POLITICAL POWER TO THEIR IDEALS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE
4088-158077-0009 THE THOUSAND DELEGATES PRESENT AT THE CONVENTION THOUGH DIFFERING WIDELY ON THE DUTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN WAR WERE UNANIMOUS IN VOTING THAT IN THE EVENT OF WAR THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK FOR POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR WOMEN AND FOR THAT ALONE
4088-158077-0010 BELIEVING AS THE CONVENTION STATED IN ITS RESOLUTIONS THAT IN SO DOING THE ORGANIZATION SERVES THE HIGHEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY
4088-158077-0011 THEY WERE ALSO UNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT ALL SERVICE WHICH INDIVIDUALS WISHED TO GIVE TO WAR OR PEACE SHOULD BE GIVEN THROUGH GROUPS ORGANIZED FOR SUCH PURPOSES
4088-158077-0012 FOR ONE PURPOSE ONLY TO SECURE AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ENFRANCHISING WOMEN WE DECLARED OFFICIALLY THROUGH OUR ORGAN THAT THIS HELD AS THE POLICY OF THE WOMAN'S PARTY WHATEVER TURN PUBLIC EVENTS MAY TAKE
4088-158077-0013 AND ANNOUNCED THAT NO SUBJECTS WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THEM UNLESS THE PRESIDENT URGED THEM AS WAR MEASURES OUR TASK WAS FROM THAT TIME ON TO MAKE NATIONAL SUFFRAGE A WAR MEASURE WE AT ONCE URGED UPON THE ADMINISTRATION THE WISDOM OF ACCEPTING THIS PROPOSED REFORM AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0014 AND POINTED OUT THE DIFFICULTY OF WAGING A WAR FOR DEMOCRACY ABROAD WHILE DEMOCRACY WAS DENIED AT HOME BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT WILLING TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF ITS ALLIES IN EXTENDING SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN WITHOUT FIRST OFFERING A TERRIBLE AND BRUTAL RESISTANCE
4088-158077-0015 WAS MOST PERPLEXING HERE WERE WE CITIZENS WITHOUT POWER AND RECOGNITION WITH THE ONLY WEAPONS TO WHICH A POWERLESS CLASS WHICH DOES NOT TAKE UP ARMS CAN RESORT WE COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT FIGHT WITH MEN'S WEAPONS
4088-158077-0016 COMPARE THE METHODS WOMEN ADOPTED TO THOSE MEN USE IN THE PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY
4088-158077-0017 BAYONETS MACHINE GUNS POISON GAS DEADLY GRENADES LIQUID FIRE BOMBS ARMORED TANKS PISTOLS BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS SUBMARINES MINES EVERY KNOWN SCIENTIFIC DEVICE WITH WHICH TO ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY
4088-158077-0018 WHAT DID WE DO WE CONTINUED TO FIGHT WITH OUR SIMPLE PEACEFUL ALMOST QUAINT DEVICE A BANNER A LITTLE MORE FIERY PERHAPS PERTINENT TO THE LATEST POLITICAL CONTROVERSY BUT STILL ONLY A BANNER INSCRIBED WITH MILITANT TRUTH
4088-158077-0019 JUST AS OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE AT ELECTIONS THE PARTY IN POWER WHICH HAD FAILED TO USE ITS POWER TO FREE WOMEN SO NOW OUR MILITARY STRATEGY WAS BASED ON THE MILITARY DOCTRINE OF CONCENTRATING ALL ONE'S FORCES ON THE ENEMY'S WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0020 AND THE DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME THIS WAS THE UNTENABLE POSITION OF PRESIDENT WILSON AND THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION FROM WHICH WE MUST FORCE THEM TO RETREAT WE COULD FORCE SUCH A RETREAT WHEN WE HAD EXPOSED TO THE WORLD THIS WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0021 JUST AS THE BLUFF OF A DEMOCRATIC CRUSADE MUST BE CALLED SO MUST THE KNIGHT LEADER OF THE CRUSADE BE EXPOSED TO THE CRITICAL EYES OF THE WORLD
4088-158077-0022 HERE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS HERE WAS A KIND OF UNIVERSAL MOSES EXPECTED TO LEAD ALL PEOPLES OUT OF BONDAGE NO MATTER WHAT THE BONDAGE NO MATTER OF HOW LONG STANDING
4088-158077-0023 IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US IN THAT IT MADE OUR ATTACK MORE DRAMATIC ONE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPECCABLE WAS MORE VULNERABLE IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS UNIVERSAL TRUST AND WORLD WIDE POPULARITY
4088-158077-0024 BUT THIS CONFLICT OF WITS AND BRAINS AGAINST POWER ONLY ENHANCED OUR INGENUITY ON THE DAY THE ENGLISH MISSION HEADED BY MISTER BALFOUR AND THE FRENCH MISSION HEADED BY M VIVIANI VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE WE TOOK THESE INSCRIPTIONS TO THE PICKET LINE
4088-158077-0025 IN OUR CAPACITY TO EMBARRASS MISTER WILSON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION LAY OUR ONLY HOPE OF SUCCESS
4088-158077-0026 WE INTENDED TO KNOW WHY IF DEMOCRACY WERE SO PRECIOUS AS TO DEMAND THE NATION'S BLOOD AND TREASURE FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENT ABROAD ITS EXECUTION AT HOME WAS SO UNDESIRABLE MEANWHILE
4088-158077-0027 I TELL YOU SOLEMNLY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE CANNOT ANY LONGER POSTPONE JUSTICE IN THESE UNITED STATES
4088-158077-0028 AND IF HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO MY ADVICE I AM GOING TO MAKE IT AS UNPLEASANT AS I CAN PRESIDENT WILSON
4088-158077-0029 SOME RUMBLINGS OF POLITICAL ACTION BEGAN TO BE HEARD THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY HAD APPOINTED A SENATE COMMITTEE ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE WHOSE MEMBERS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR FEDERAL ACTION THE CHAIRMAN SENATOR ANDREAS JONES OF NEW MEXICO
4088-158077-0030 PROMISED AN EARLY REPORT TO THE SENATE THERE WERE SCORES OF GAINS IN CONGRESS REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS WERE TUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER TO INTRODUCE SIMILAR SUFFRAGE RESOLUTIONS WE ACTUALLY HAD DIFFICULTY IN CHOOSING THE MAN WHOSE NAME SHOULD STAMP OUR MEASURE
4088-158077-0031 IN ADDITION TO THIS PLANK THEY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME
4088-158077-0032 AND INSTRUCTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONVENTION TO REQUEST A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL LIBERAL GROUPS
4088-158077-0033 THEY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE FROM THE CONVENTION TO CARRY THESE RESOLUTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT THE COMMITTEE INCLUDED MISTER J A H HOPKINS OF THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY AS CHAIRMAN
4088-158077-0034 MISTER JOHN SPARGO OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY MISTER VIRGIL HINSHAW CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PROHIBITION PARTY AND MISS MABEL VERNON SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY
4088-158077-0035 THE PRESIDENT WAS DEEPLY MOVED INDEED ALMOST TO THE POINT OF TEARS WHEN MISS MABEL VERNON SAID MISTER PRESIDENT THE FEELINGS OF MANY WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BEST EXPRESSED BY YOUR OWN WORDS IN YOUR WAR MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
4088-158077-0036 WE WERE NOT PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN THE AMPLIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL MACHINERY UNLESS THIS AMPLIFICATION WAS TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE AMENDMENT THE PRESIDENT COULD AS EASILY HAVE WRITTEN THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON SUFFRAGE OR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE
4088-158077-0037 ADVISING AN IMMEDIATE REPORT ON THE SUFFRAGE RESOLUTION AS HAVE ASKED FOR THE CREATION OF ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO REPORT ON THE SUBJECT HE MADE NO MENTION OF HIS STATE BY STATE CONVICTION HOWEVER AS HE HAD IN PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS
4088-158077-0038 AND THE COMMITTEE OF PROGRESSIVES UNDERSTOOD HIM TO HAVE AT LEAST TACITLY ACCEPTED FEDERAL ACTION THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO ACT AND THE HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE STEADILY REFUSED TO CREATE A SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0039 HOPING TO WIN BACK TO THE FOLD THE WANDERING PROGRESSIVES WHO HAD THUS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO SUFFRAGE AND SEEING AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMBARRASS THE ADMINISTRATION THE REPUBLICANS BEGAN TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN ACTION ON THE AMENDMENT
4088-158077-0040 THE AUTHORIZATION OF AN EXPENDITURE OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ERECTION OF A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AS A LEGITIMATE WAR MEASURE IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE PARTISAN ATTITUDE OF THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THE DEBATE
4088-158077-0041 THAT WE WERE ADVANCING TO THAT POSITION WHERE WE WERE AS GOOD POLITICAL MATERIAL TO BE CONTESTED OVER BY OPPOSING POLITICAL GROUPS AS WAS A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AND IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEND SUCH AN ISSUE AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0042 THE ADMINISTRATION WAS AROUSED IT DID NOT KNOW HOW FAR THE REPUBLICANS WERE PREPARED TO GO IN THEIR DRIVE FOR ACTION SO ON THE DAY OF THIS FLURRY IN THE HOUSE THE SNAIL LIKE RULES COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0043 AND BY A VOTE OF SIX TO FIVE DECIDED TO REPORT FAVORABLY ON THE RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR A WOMAN SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE AFTER ALL PENDING WAR MEASURES HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF BEFORE THE MEETING
4088-158077-0044 THE PICKETS CONTINUED THEIR VIGIL AND THE MOTION CARRIED STILL UNCERTAIN AS TO THE PURPOSES OF THE REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS WERE MOVED TO FURTHER ACTION
4088-158077-0045 MEETING IN WASHINGTON A FEW DAYS LATER VOTED FOUR TO NINE TO OFFICIALLY URGE UPON THE PRESIDENT THAT HE CALL THE TWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS TOGETHER AND RECOMMEND THE IMMEDIATE SUBMISSION OF THE SUSAN B ANTHONY AMENDMENT THIS ACTION WHICH IN EFFECT REVERSED THE PLANK IN THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
4088-158077-0046 EVIDENTLY AROUSED PROTESTS FROM POWERFUL QUARTERS ALSO THE REPUBLICANS QUICKLY SUBSIDED WHEN THEY SAW THE DEMOCRATS MAKING AN ADVANCE AND SO THE DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BEGAN TO SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWS THAT ITS ACT WAS NOT REALLY OFFICIAL
4088-158077-0047 BUT MERELY REFLECTED THE PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT IT EXTRACTED THE OFFICIAL FLAVOR AND SO OF COURSE NO ACTION FOLLOWED IN CONGRESS AND SO IT WENT LIKE A GREAT GAME OF CHESS
4088-158077-0048 THE FACT WAS THAT THE PICKETS HAD MOVED THE DEMOCRATS A STEP
4088-158077-0049 BEHIND THIS MATCHING OF POLITICAL WITS BY THE TWO PARTIES STOOD THE FAITHFUL PICKETS COMPELLING THEM BOTH TO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THESE MOVES AND COUNTER MOVES IN POLITICAL CIRCLES THE PEOPLE IN ALL SECTIONS OF THIS VAST COUNTRY BEGAN TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS
4088-158077-0050 MEETINGS WERE SPRINGING UP EVERYWHERE AT WHICH RESOLUTIONS WERE PASSED BACKING UP THE PICKET LINE AND URGING THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO ACT EVEN THE SOUTH THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRONGHOLD SENT FIERY TELEGRAMS DEMANDING ACTION
4088-158077-0051 ALABAMA SOUTH CAROLINA TEXAS MARYLAND MISSISSIPPI AS WELL AS THE WEST MIDDLE WEST NEW ENGLAND AND THE EAST THE STREAM WAS ENDLESS EVERY TIME A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THE WAR TAX BILL
4088-158077-0052 FOOD CONSERVATION OR WHAT NOT WOMEN FROM UNEX PECTED QUARTERS SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT THEIR PROTEST AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF MEASURES SO VITAL TO WOMEN WITHOUT WOMEN'S CONSENT COUPLED WITH AN APPEAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN
4088-158077-0053 CLUB WOMEN COLLEGE WOMEN FEDERATIONS OF LABOR VARIOUS KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS SENT PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION LEADERS THE PICKET LINE APPROACHING ITS SIXTH MONTH OF DUTY HAD AROUSED THE COUNTRY TO AN UNPRECEDENTED INTEREST IN SUF FRAGE
4088-158077-0054 IT HAD RALLIED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC SUPPORT TO THE AMEND MENT AS A WAR MEASURE AND HAD ITSELF BECOME ALMOST UNIVER SALLY ACCEPTED IF NOT UNIVERSALLY APPROVED AND IN THE MIDST OF PICKETING ANDS IN SPITE OF ALL THE PROPHECIES AND FEARS THAT PICKETING WOULD SET BACK THE CAUSE
4088-158077-0055 WITHIN ONE MONTH MICHIGAN NEBRASKA AND RHODE ISLAND GRANTED PRESIDENTIAL SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN THE LEADERS WERE BUSY MARSHALING THEIR FORCES BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S WAR PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED THE CONTROVERSIAL CONSCRIPTION AND ESPIONAGE BILLS THEN PENDING
4088-158077-0056 AND DID NOT RELISH HAVING OUR QUESTION SO VIVID IN THE PUBLIC MIND
4088-158077-0057 THEY HAD TO FACE A POSSIBLE CHARGE OF INCONSISTENCY INSINCERITY OR BAD FAITH THE FREEDOM OF IRELAND FOR EXAMPLE WAS NOT IN THE PROGRAM
4088-158077-0058 THE MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULAR APPROVAL OF SUFFRAGE THE CONSTANT STREAM OF PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AGAINST ITS DELAY NATIONALLY AND THE SHAME OF HAVING WOMEN BEGGING AT ITS GATES COULD RESULT IN ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS
4088-158077-0059 THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LITTLE CHOICE IT MUST YIELD TO THIS PRESSURE FROM THE PEOPLE OR IT MUST SUPPRESS THE AGITATION WHICH WAS CAUSING SUCH INTEREST IT MUST PASS THE AMENDMENT OR REMOVE THE TROUBLESOME PICKETS IT DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PICKETS
4088-158077-0060 THE FIRST ARRESTS THE ADMINISTRATION CHOSE SUPPRESSION THEY RESORTED TO FORCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO END PICKETING IT WAS A POLICY DOOMED TO FAILURE AS CERTAINLY AS ALL RESORTS TO FORCE TO KILL AGITATION HAVE FAILED ULTIMATELY
4088-158077-0061 THIS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE ADOPTION BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF TACTICS FROM WHICH THEY COULD NEVER EXTRICATE THEMSELVES WITH HONOR UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM THEY WERE ENTERING UPON THIS POLICY TOWARD WOMEN WHICH SAVORED OF CZARIST PRACTICES
4088-158077-0062 AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY WERE CONGRATULATING THE RUSSIANS UPON THEIR LIBERATION FROM THE OPPRESSION OF A CZAR THIS FACT SUPPLIED US WITH A FRESH ANGLE OF ATTACK PRESIDENT WILSON SENT A MISSION TO RUSSIA TO ADD AMERICA'S APPEAL TO THAT OF THE OTHER ALLIES TO KEEP THAT IMPOVERISHED COUNTRY IN THE WAR
4088-158077-0063 SUCH WAS OUR DEMOCRATIC ZEAL TO PERSUADE RUSSIA TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND TO CONVINCE HER PEOPLE OF ITS DEMOCRATIC PURPOSES AND OF THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY OF AMERICA
4088-158077-0064 THIS OCCASION OFFERED US THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO EXPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS IN CLAIMING COMPLETE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY WHILE WOMEN WERE STILL DENIED THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM
4088-158077-0065 AS THE CAR CARRYING THE ENVOYS PASSED SWIFTLY THROUGH THE GATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE THERE STOOD ON THE PICKET LINE TWO SILENT SENTINELS MISS LUCY BURNS OF NEW YORK AND MISSUS LAWRENCE LEWIS OF PHILADELPHIA BOTH MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0066 WITH A GREAT LETTERED BANNER WHICH READ TO THE RUSSIAN ENVOYS PRESIDENT WILSON AND ENVOY ROOT ARE DECEIVING RUSSIA WHEN THEY SAY WE ARE A DEMOCRACY HELP US WIN THE WORLD WAR SO THAT DEMOCRACY MAY SURVIVE WE THE WOMEN OF AMERICA
4088-158077-0067 TWENTY MILLION AMERI CAN WOMEN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE PRESI DENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THEIR NA TIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE TELL OUR GOVERNMENT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY
4088-158077-0068 RUMORS THAT THE SUFFRAGISTS WOULD MAKE A SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE RUSSIAN MISSION HAD BROUGHT A GREAT CROWD TO THE FAR GATE OF THE WHITE HOUSE A CROWD COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF MEN
4088-158077-0069 LIKE ALL CROWDS THIS CROWD HAD ITS SHARE OF HOODLUMS AND ROUGHS WHO TRIED TO INTERFERE WITH THE WOMEN'S ORDER OF THE DAY THERE WAS A FLURRY OF EXCITEMENT OVER THIS DEFIANT MESSAGE OF TRUTH BUT NOTHING THAT COULD NOT WITH THE UTMOST EASE HAVE BEEN SETTLED BY ONE POLICEMAN
4088-158077-0070 THERE WAS THE CRITICISM IN THE PRESS AND ON THE LIPS OF MEN THAT WE WERE EMBARRASSING OUR GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE EYES OF FOREIGN VISITORS IN ANSWERING THE CRITICISM MISS PAUL PUBLICLY STATED OUR POSITION THUS
4088-158077-0071 CAN BE CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR PROTEST IS THEREFORE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOT WITH THE WOMEN OF AMERICA IF THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME WEAKENS THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158077-0072 IN ITS FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY THIS WAS TOO DREADFUL A FLURRY AT THE GATES OF THE CHIEF OF THE NATION AT SUCH A TIME WOULD NEVER DO OUR ALLIES IN THE CRUSADE FOR DEMOCRACY MUST NOT KNOW THAT WE HAD A DAY BY DAY UNREST AT HOME
4088-158077-0073 WHAT A PICTURE COMMON DECENCY TOLD THE MORE HUMANE LEADERS THAT THIS WOULD NEVER DO I DARESAY POLITICAL WISDOM CREPT INTO THE REASONING OF OTHERS CLOSING THE WOMAN'S PARTY HEADQUARTERS WAS DISCUSSED PERHAPS A RAID AND ALL FOR WHAT
4088-158077-0074 BECAUSE WOMEN WERE HOLDING BANNERS ASKING FOR THE PRECIOUS PRINCIPLE AT HOME THAT MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DYING FOR ABROAD FINALLY A DECISION WAS REACHED EMBODYING THE COMBINED WISDOM OF ALL THE VARIOUS CONFEREES
4088-158077-0075 THE CHIEF OF POLICE MAJOR PULLMAN WAS DETAILED TO REQUEST US TO STOP PICKETING AND TO TELL US THAT IF WE CONTINUED TO PICKET WE WOULD BE ARRESTED WE HAVE PICKETED FOR SIX MONTHS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE SAID MISS PAUL HAS THE LAW BEEN CHANGED
4088-158077-0076 NO WAS THE REPLY BUT YOU MUST STOP IT
4088-158077-0077 THE FOLLOWING DAY MISS LUCY BURNS AND MISS KATHERINE MOREY OF BOSTON CARRIED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES WE SHALL FIGHT FOR THE THINGS WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD NEAREST OUR HEARTS FOR DEMOCRACY FOR THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY
4088-158077-0078 TO HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT
4088-158077-0079 NEWS HAD SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY THAT THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED A MODERATELY LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED TO SEE THE FUN ONE HAS ONLY TO COME INTO CONFLICT WITH PREVAILING AUTHORITY WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY TO FIND FRIENDLY HOSTS VANISHING WITH LIGHTNING SPEED
4088-158077-0080 TO KNOW THAT WE WERE NO LONGER WANTED AT THE GATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND THAT THE POLICE WERE NO LONGER OUR FRIENDS WAS ENOUGH FOR THE MOB MIND SOME MEMBERS OF THE CROWD MADE SPORT OF THE WOMEN OTHERS HURLED CHEAP AND CHILDISH EPITHETS AT THEM SMALL BOYS WERE ALLOWED TO CAPTURE SOUVENIRS
4088-158077-0081 AS TROPHIES OF THE SPORT THINKING THEY HAD BEEN MISTAKEN IN BELIEVING THE PICKETS WERE TO BE ARRESTED AND HAVING GROWN WEARY OF THEIR STRENUOUS SPORT THE CROWD MOVED ON ITS WAY TWO SOLITARY FIGURES REMAINED STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK FLANKED BY THE VAST PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
4088-158077-0082 UPON KNOWING THE CHARGE AGAINST THEM MAJOR PULLMAN AND HIS ENTIRE STAFF WERE UTTERLY AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LOOKED AHEAD ONLY AS FAR AS THREATENING ARREST THEY DOUBTLESS THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO
4088-158077-0083 AND NEVER BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE FOLLOWING DAY JUNE TWENTY THIRD MORE ARRESTS WERE MADE TWO WOMEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE TWO AT THE CAPITOL ALL CARRIED BANNERS WITH THE SAME WORDS OF THE PRESIDENT THERE WAS NO HESITATION THIS TIME THEY WERE PROMPTLY ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC
4088-158077-0084 THEY TOO WERE DISMISSED AND THEIR CASES NEVER TRIED
4088-158077-0085 WHEN HOWEVER WOMEN CONTINUED TO PICKET IN THE FACE OF ARREST THE ADMINISTRATION QUICKENED ITS ADVANCE INTO THE VENTURE OF SUPPRESSION IT DECIDED TO BRING THE OFFENDERS TO TRIAL ON JUNE TWENTY SIXTH
4088-158077-0086 TO PAY A FINE WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF GUILT WE ARE INNOCENT THE SIX WOMEN WHO WERE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE THE FIRST TERMS OF IMPRISONMENT FOR SUFFRAGE IN THIS COUNTRY WERE MISS KATHERINE MOREY OF MASSACHUSETTS MISSUS ANNIE ARNEIL
4088-158077-0087 AND MISS MABEL VERNON OF DELAWARE MISS LAVINIA DOCK OF PENNSYLVANIA MISS MAUD
4088-158077-0088 INDEPENDENCE DAY JULY FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IS THE OCCASION FOR TWO DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY CHAMP CLARK LATE DEMOCRATIC SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IS DECLAIMING TO A CHEERING CROWD BEHIND THE WHITE HOUSE
4088-158077-0089 GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE THIRTEEN SILENT SENTINELS WITH BANNERS BEARING THE SAME WORDS ARE ARRESTED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY DROLL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO TRAGIC
4088-158077-0090 CHAMP CLARK AND HIS THRONG WERE NOT MOLESTED THE WOMEN WITH PRACTICALLY A DESERTED STREET WERE ARRESTED AND SERVED JAIL TERMS FOR OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC THE TRIAL OF THIS GROUP WAS DELAYED TO GIVE THE JAIL AUTHORITIES TIME TO VACATE AND TIDY UP
4088-158077-0091 AS ONE PRISONER CONFIDED TO MISS JOY YOUNG IT DEVELOPED THAT ORDERS HAD BEEN RECEIVED AT THE JAIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ARRESTS AND BEFORE THE TRIAL TO MAKE READY FOR THE SUFFRAGETTES WHAT DID IT MATTER THAT THEIR CASE HAD NOT YET BEEN HEARD
4088-158077-0092 AND WAS NOT THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA A DIRECT APPOINTEE OF THESE SAME COMMISSIONERS AND WAS NOT THE JAIL WARDEN WHO MADE LIFE FOR THE WOMEN SO UNBEARABLE IN PRISON ALSO A DIRECT APPOINTEE OF THE COMMISSIONERS
4088-158077-0093 IT WAS ALL A MERRY LITTLE RING AND ITS CAVALIER ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LAW TOWARD JUSTICE AND ABOVE ALL TOWARD WOMEN WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE THE WORLD WAS ON FIRE WITH A GRAND BLAZE THIS TINY FLAME WOULD SCARCELY BE VISIBLE
4088-158077-0094 CHAIRMAN FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE TO ALL NEWSPAPERS POST OFFICES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES OF A PUBLIC CHARACTER FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF OFFICIAL NEWS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WASHINGTON JULY THIRD NINETEEN SEVENTEEN
4088-158077-0095 AND REPORTERS NOT TO ENCOURAGE US IN OUR PECULIAR CONDUCT BY PRINTING DEFIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN WHEN FLAUNTED ON A PRETTY LITTLE PURPLE AND GOLD BANNER AND EXHORTS THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL ITS THRILLS
4088-158077-0096 THE OFFICIAL BULLETIN CONCLUDES WITH IT IS A FACT THAT THERE REMAINS IN AMERICA ONE MAN WHO HAS KNOWN EXACTLY THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TO TAKE AND MAINTAIN TOWARD THE PICKETS
4088-158077-0097 A POLITE BOW AND FOR THE REST A COMPLETE IGNORING OF THEIR EXISTENCE HE HAPPENS TO BE THE MAN AROUND WHOM THE LITTLE WHIRLWIND
4088-158077-0098 AND FINALLY WITH AN ADMONITION THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY
