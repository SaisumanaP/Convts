4640-19187-0000 AND JUNE EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT IT THAN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO SO THE BARRICADE OF THE
4640-19187-0001 AND AN EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE TWO COLOSSAL BARRICADES WHICH WE HAVE JUST SKETCHED BUT IT WAS FORMIDABLE FOR THAT EPOCH
4640-19187-0002 ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL CONFUSION THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
4640-19187-0003 THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED
4640-19187-0004 THE KITCHEN APPROPRIATED FOR THE AMBULANCE THE DRESSING OF THE WOUNDED COMPLETED THE POWDER SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND ON THE TABLES HAD BEEN GATHERED UP
4640-19187-0005 WHICH ALLOWED THE INSURGENTS TO BREATHE MORE FREELY THEY HAD FOUND MEANS OF TAKING REFUGE IN SOME NEIGHBORING HOUSE THE GREATER PART OF THE WOUNDED WERE ABLE AND WISHED TO FIGHT STILL
4640-19187-0006 ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
4640-19187-0007 IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS HALL BARELY LIGHTED BY A CANDLE AT ONE END THE MORTUARY TABLE BEING BEHIND THE POST LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR
4640-19187-0008 AND MABEUF LYING PRONE THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
4640-19187-0009 THE FIFTY MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED THE SCANTY PROVISIONS OF THE WINE SHOP DURING THE SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH THEY HAD PASSED THERE
4640-19187-0010 THEY HAD THEN REACHED THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT SPARTAN DAY OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE WHEN IN THE BARRICADE SAINT MERRY JEANNE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO DEMANDED BREAD REPLIED TO ALL COMBATANTS CRYING SOMETHING TO EAT
4640-19187-0011 WITH WHY
4640-19187-0012 AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT
4640-19187-0013 HE INTERDICTED WINE AND PORTIONED OUT THE BRANDY THEY HAD FOUND IN THE CELLAR FIFTEEN FULL BOTTLES HERMETICALLY SEALED
4640-19187-0014 AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
4640-19187-0015 THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
4640-19187-0016 THAT TORCH FLICKERING IN THE WIND ANNOYED ME IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING AFRAID THE LIGHT OF TORCHES RESEMBLES THE WISDOM OF COWARDS IT GIVES A BAD LIGHT BECAUSE IT TREMBLES
4640-19187-0017 DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM IT WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
4640-19187-0018 IT IS A CORRECTIVE THE GOOD GOD HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND SO HE MADE THE CAT THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
4640-19187-0019 HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
4640-19187-0020 OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF THERE BE SUCH A THING
4640-19187-0021 THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
4640-19187-0022 COMBEFERRE WAS COMPARING THE TRANSLATORS OF THE GEORGICS
4640-19187-0023 COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
4640-19187-0024 CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
4640-19187-0025 WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT
4640-19187-0026 THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19187-0027 COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT
4640-19187-0028 CAESAR IS STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS ONE FEELS THE GOD THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
4640-19187-0029 HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
4640-19187-0030 THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT
4640-19187-0031 THEY DIVIDED THE DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
4640-19187-0032 AT NOON THE INSURRECTION OF ALL PARIS AT SUNSET REVOLUTION
4640-19187-0033 WHICH RESEMBLED THE WARLIKE HUM OF A HIVE OF BEES
4640-19187-0034 HE RETURNED FROM HIS SOMBRE EAGLE FLIGHT INTO OUTER DARKNESS HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO ALL THIS JOY WITH FOLDED ARMS AND ONE HAND ON HIS MOUTH THEN
4640-19187-0035 FRESH AND ROSY IN THE GROWING WHITENESS OF THE DAWN HE SAID THE WHOLE ARMY OF PARIS IS TO STRIKE A THIRD OF THE ARMY IS BEARING DOWN UPON THE BARRICADES IN WHICH YOU NOW ARE
4640-19187-0036 AS FOR THE POPULACE IT WAS SEETHING YESTERDAY TO DAY IT IS NOT STIRRING THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NEITHER FROM A FAUBOURG NOR FROM A REGIMENT YOU ARE ABANDONED
4640-19187-0037 A MOMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE SILENCE ENSUED IN WHICH DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FLITTING BY THIS MOMENT WAS BRIEF
4640-19187-0038 SO BE IT LET US RAISE THE BARRICADE TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET AND LET US ALL REMAIN IN IT CITIZENS LET US OFFER THE PROTESTS OF CORPSES
4640-19187-0039 IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
4640-19187-0040 AT A GIVEN MOMENT UTTERS IN A SUPREME FASHION THE DECISIVE WORD AND WHO VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED FOR A MINUTE IN A LIGHTNING FLASH THE PEOPLE AND GOD
4640-19187-0041 LET US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN
