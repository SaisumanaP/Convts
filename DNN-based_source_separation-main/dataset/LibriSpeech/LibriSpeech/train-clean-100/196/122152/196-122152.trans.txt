196-122152-0000 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
196-122152-0001 AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
196-122152-0002 THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
196-122152-0003 AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
196-122152-0004 FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
196-122152-0005 OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0006 CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
196-122152-0007 AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
196-122152-0008 LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0009 I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
196-122152-0010 HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
196-122152-0011 I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
196-122152-0012 TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
196-122152-0013 HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
196-122152-0014 STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
196-122152-0015 WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
196-122152-0016 WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
196-122152-0017 THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
196-122152-0018 PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
196-122152-0019 AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
196-122152-0020 HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
196-122152-0021 FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
196-122152-0022 THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
196-122152-0023 HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
196-122152-0024 AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
196-122152-0025 RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
196-122152-0026 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
196-122152-0027 IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
196-122152-0028 HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
196-122152-0030 THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
196-122152-0031 AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
196-122152-0032 HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
196-122152-0033 OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
