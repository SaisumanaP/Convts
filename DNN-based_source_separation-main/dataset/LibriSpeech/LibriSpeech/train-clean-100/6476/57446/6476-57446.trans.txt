6476-57446-0000 BUT IN THE MIDST OF GAIETY HIS HEART YEARNED ALL THE WHILE FOR HIS LOST LOVE AND HIS MERRIMENT WAS BUT MOURNING IN DISGUISE AT LAST THE NIGHT WORE ON AND AS HE WAS RETIRING ALONG THE CORRIDOR HE SAW A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
6476-57446-0001 WITH LONG HAIR COMING TOWARDS HIM WHO WHEN HE SAW GENZABURO CRIED OUT DEAR ME WHY THIS MUST BE MY YOUNG LORD GENZABURO WHO HAS COME OUT TO ENJOY HIMSELF GENZABURO THOUGHT THIS RATHER STRANGE BUT
6476-57446-0002 LOOKING AT THE MAN ATTENTIVELY RECOGNIZED HIM AS A RETAINER WHOM HE HAD HAD IN HIS EMPLOY THE YEAR BEFORE AND SAID THIS IS A CURIOUS MEETING PRAY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT SINCE YOU LEFT MY SERVICE AT ANY RATE
6476-57446-0003 I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING WELL AND STRONG WHERE ARE YOU LIVING NOW WELL SIR SINCE I PARTED FROM YOU I HAVE BEEN EARNING A LIVING AS A FORTUNE TELLER AT KANDA AND HAVE CHANGED MY NAME TO KAJI SAZEN
6476-57446-0004 I AM LIVING IN A POOR AND HUMBLE HOUSE BUT IF YOUR LORDSHIP AT YOUR LEISURE WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A VISIT WELL IT'S A LUCKY CHANCE THAT HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AND I CERTAINLY WILL GO AND SEE YOU BESIDES I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME
6476-57446-0005 SHALL YOU BE AT HOME THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW CERTAINLY SIR I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF BEING AT HOME VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW I WILL GO TO YOUR HOUSE I SHALL BE AT YOUR SERVICE SIR AND NOW AS IT IS GETTING LATE
6476-57446-0006 I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE FOR TO NIGHT GOOD NIGHT THEN WE SHALL MEET THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW AND SO THE TWO PARTED AND WENT THEIR SEVERAL WAYS TO REST ON THE APPOINTED DAY GENZABURO MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND WENT IN DISGUISE WITHOUT ANY RETAINERS
6476-57446-0007 TO CALL UPON SAZEN WHO MET HIM AT THE PORCH OF HIS HOUSE AND SAID THIS IS A GREAT HONOUR MY LORD GENZABURO IS INDEED WELCOME MY HOUSE IS VERY MEAN BUT LET ME INVITE YOUR LORDSHIP TO COME INTO AN INNER CHAMBER
6476-57446-0008 PRAY REPLIED GENZABURO DON'T MAKE ANY CEREMONY FOR ME DON'T PUT YOURSELF TO ANY TROUBLE ON MY ACCOUNT AND SO HE PASSED IN AND SAZEN CALLED TO HIS WIFE TO PREPARE WINE AND CONDIMENTS AND THEY BEGAN TO FEAST
6476-57446-0009 AT LAST GENZABURO LOOKING SAZEN IN THE FACE SAID THERE IS A SERVICE WHICH I WANT YOU TO RENDER ME A VERY SECRET SERVICE BUT AS IF YOU WERE TO REFUSE ME I SHOULD BE PUT TO SHAME BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT THAT SERVICE IS
6476-57446-0010 WELL THEN SAID GENZABURO GREATLY PLEASED AND DRAWING TEN RIYOS FROM HIS BOSOM THIS IS BUT A SMALL PRESENT TO MAKE TO YOU ON MY FIRST VISIT BUT PRAY ACCEPT IT NO INDEED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LORDSHIP WISHES OF ME
6476-57446-0011 HOW HE HAD FIRST MET HER AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AT THE ADZUMA BRIDGE HOW CHOKICHI HAD INTRODUCED HER TO HIM AT THE TEA HOUSE AT OJI AND THEN WHEN SHE FELL ILL AND HE WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN INSTEAD OF BRINGING HER TO HIM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM GOOD ADVICE
6476-57446-0012 AND SO GENZABURO DREW A LAMENTABLE PICTURE OF HIS STATE OF DESPAIR SAZEN LISTENED PATIENTLY TO HIS STORY AND AFTER REFLECTING FOR A WHILE REPLIED WELL SIR IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO SET RIGHT
6476-57446-0013 WHEN GENZABURO HEARD THIS HE FELT GREATLY RELIEVED AND RECOMMENDING SAZEN TO DO HIS BEST IN THE MATTER TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETURNED HOME THAT VERY NIGHT SAZEN AFTER THINKING OVER ALL THAT GENZABURO HAD TOLD HIM
6476-57446-0014 LAID HIS PLANS ACCORDINGLY AND WENT OFF TO THE HOUSE OF KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND TOLD HIM THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED KIHACHI WAS OF COURSE GREATLY ASTONISHED AND SAID SOME TIME AGO SIR CHOKICHI CAME HERE
6476-57446-0015 AND SAID THAT MY LORD GENZABURO HAVING BEEN REBUKED BY HIS FAMILY FOR HIS PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOUR HAD DETERMINED TO BREAK OFF HIS CONNECTION WITH MY DAUGHTER OF COURSE I KNEW THAT THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA WAS NO FITTING MATCH FOR A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0016 SO WHEN CHOKICHI CAME AND TOLD ME THE ERRAND UPON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ANNOUNCE TO MY DAUGHTER THAT SHE MUST GIVE UP ALL THOUGHT OF HIS LORDSHIP SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS BEEN FRETTING AND PINING AND STARVING FOR LOVE
6476-57446-0017 BUT WHEN I TELL HER WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID HOW GLAD AND HAPPY SHE WILL BE LET ME GO AND TALK TO HER AT ONCE
6476-57446-0018 WELL AT ANY RATE I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU THAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY A MESSENGER HAS COME FROM MY LORD GENZABURO FOR WHOM YOUR HEART YEARNS AT THIS O KOYO WHO HAD BEEN CROUCHING DOWN LIKE A DROOPING FLOWER GAVE A GREAT START AND CRIED OUT IS THAT REALLY TRUE
6476-57446-0019 IT IS CHOKICHI WHO HAS BEEN THROWING OBSTACLES IN THE WAY AT LAST HIS LORDSHIP HAS SECRETLY SENT A MAN CALLED KAJI SAZEN A FORTUNE TELLER TO ARRANGE AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN YOU SO NOW MY CHILD YOU MAY CHEER UP
6476-57446-0020 AND GO TO MEET YOUR LOVER AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE WHEN O KOYO HEARD THIS SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT IT MUST ALL BE A DREAM AND DOUBTED HER OWN SENSES KIHACHI IN THE MEANWHILE REJOINED SAZEN IN THE OTHER ROOM AND
6476-57446-0021 AFTER TELLING HIM OF THE JOY WITH WHICH HIS DAUGHTER HAD HEARD THE NEWS PUT BEFORE HIM WINE AND OTHER DELICACIES I THINK SAID SAZEN THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR O KOYO TO LIVE SECRETLY IN MY LORD GENZABURO'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0022 BUT AS IT WILL NEVER DO FOR ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW OF IT IT MUST BE MANAGED VERY QUIETLY AND FURTHER WHEN I GET HOME I MUST THINK OUT SOME PLAN TO LULL THE SUSPICIONS OF THAT FELLOW CHOKICHI AND LET YOU KNOW MY IDEA BY LETTER
6476-57446-0023 MEANWHILE O KOYO HAD BETTER COME HOME WITH ME TO NIGHT ALTHOUGH SHE IS SO TERRIBLY OUT OF SPIRITS NOW SHE SHALL MEET GENZABURO THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW KIHACHI REPORTED THIS TO O KOYO AND AS HER PINING FOR GENZABURO WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER SICKNESS
6476-57446-0024 SHE RECOVERED HER SPIRITS AT ONCE AND SAYING THAT SHE WOULD GO WITH SAZEN IMMEDIATELY JOYFULLY MADE HER PREPARATIONS THEN SAZEN HAVING ONCE MORE WARNED KIHACHI TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET FROM CHOKICHI AND TO ACT UPON THE LETTER WHICH HE SHOULD SEND HIM
6476-57446-0025 RETURNED HOME TAKING WITH HIM O KOYO AND AFTER O KOYO HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HER HAIR AND PAINTED HERSELF AND PUT ON BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES SHE CAME OUT LOOKING SO LOVELY THAT NO PRINCESS IN THE LAND COULD VIE WITH HER AND SAZEN WHEN HE SAW HER
6476-57446-0026 SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NO WONDER THAT GENZABURO HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER THEN AS IT WAS GETTING LATE HE ADVISED HER TO GO TO REST AND AFTER SHOWING HER TO HER APARTMENTS WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM AND WROTE HIS LETTER TO KIHACHI
6476-57446-0027 CONTAINING THE SCHEME WHICH HE HAD DEVISED WHEN KIHACHI RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT SAZEN'S INGENUITY AND PUTTING ON AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT ALARM AND AGITATION
6476-57446-0028 WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY TO CALL ON CHOKICHI AND SAID TO HIM OH MASTER CHOKICHI SUCH A TERRIBLE THING HAS HAPPENED PRAY LET ME TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT INDEED WHAT CAN IT BE OH SIR ANSWERED KIHACHI
6476-57446-0029 PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY HIS TEARS MY DAUGHTER O KOYO MOURNING OVER HER SEPARATION FROM MY LORD GENZABURO AT FIRST REFUSED ALL SUSTENANCE AND REMAINED NURSING HER SORROWS UNTIL LAST NIGHT HER WOMAN'S HEART FAILING TO BEAR UP AGAINST HER GREAT GRIEF
6476-57446-0030 SHE DROWNED HERSELF IN THE RIVER LEAVING BEHIND HER A PAPER ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN HER INTENTION WHEN CHOKICHI HEARD THIS HE WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND EXCLAIMED CAN THIS REALLY BE TRUE AND WHEN I THINK THAT IT WAS I WHO FIRST INTRODUCED HER TO MY LORD
6476-57446-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK YOU IN THE FACE OH SAY NOT SO MISFORTUNES ARE THE PUNISHMENT DUE FOR OUR MISDEEDS IN A FORMER STATE OF EXISTENCE I BEAR YOU NO ILL WILL THIS MONEY WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND WAS MY DAUGHTER'S
6476-57446-0032 TO YOU THROUGH WHOSE INTERVENTION SHE BECAME ALLIED WITH A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0033 YOU AMAZE ME REPLIED THE OTHER HOW COULD I ABOVE ALL MEN
6476-57446-0034 AT LAST CHOKICHI AFTER MUCH PERSUASION AND GREATLY TO HIS OWN DISTRESS WAS OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE MONEY AND WHEN KIHACHI HAD CARRIED OUT ALL SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS HE RETURNED HOME
6476-57446-0035 AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT IT WAS THE VERY LETTER WHICH CONTAINED SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS TO KIHACHI AND IN WHICH THE WHOLE STORY WHICH HAD JUST AFFECTED HIM SO MUCH WAS MADE UP WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON HIM HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND EXCLAIMED
6476-57446-0036 AND ALL IN VAIN WELL THEY'VE GULLED ME ONCE BUT I'LL BE EVEN WITH THEM YET AND HINDER THEIR GAME BEFORE IT IS PLAYED OUT
6476-57446-0037 AND WENT OFF SECRETLY TO PROWL ABOUT SAZEN'S HOUSE TO WATCH FOR O KOYO DETERMINED TO PAY OFF GENZABURO AND SAZEN FOR THEIR CONDUCT TO HIM IN THE MEANWHILE SAZEN WHO DID NOT FOR A MOMENT SUSPECT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
6476-57446-0038 WHEN THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED UPON BY HIM AND GENZABURO ARRIVED MADE O KOYO PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES SMARTENED UP HIS HOUSE AND GOT READY A FEAST AGAINST GENZABURO'S ARRIVAL THE LATTER CAME PUNCTUALLY TO HIS TIME
6476-57446-0039 AND GOING IN AT ONCE SAID TO THE FORTUNE TELLER
6476-57446-0040 LOST HEART ENTIRELY AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO HOME AGAIN SAZEN HOWEVER PRESSED HIM SO EAGERLY THAT AT LAST HE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SEE THIS VAUNTED BEAUTY AND SAZEN DRAWING ASIDE A SCREEN SHOWED HIM O KOYO WHO WAS SITTING THERE
6476-57446-0041 PRAY DON'T MENTION IT SIR BUT AS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE YOU HAVE MET THE YOUNG LADY YOU MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER SO I WILL GO DOWNSTAIRS AND IF YOU WANT ANYTHING PRAY CALL ME AND SO HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND LEFT THEM
6476-57446-0042 THEN GENZABURO ADDRESSING O KOYO SAID AH IT IS INDEED A LONG TIME SINCE WE MET HOW HAPPY IT MAKES ME TO SEE YOU AGAIN WHY YOUR FACE HAS GROWN QUITE THIN POOR THING HAVE YOU BEEN UNHAPPY
6476-57446-0043 AND O KOYO WITH THE TEARS STARTING FROM HER EYES FOR JOY HID HER FACE AND HER HEART WAS SO FULL THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT GENZABURO PASSING HIS HAND GENTLY OVER HER HEAD AND BACK AND COMFORTING HER SAID
6476-57446-0044 COME SWEETHEART THERE IS NO NEED TO SOB SO TALK TO ME A LITTLE AND LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE AT LAST O KOYO RAISED HER HEAD AND SAID AH
6476-57446-0045 AND THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD NEVER MEET YOU AGAIN HOW TENDERLY I THOUGHT OF YOU
6476-57446-0046 SAZEN CAME WITH A MESSAGE FROM YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL A DREAM AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE BENT HER HEAD AND SOBBED AGAIN AND IN GENZABURO'S EYES SHE SEEMED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER
6476-57446-0047 WITH HER PALE DELICATE FACE AND HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN BEFORE THEN SHE SAID
6476-57446-0048 I SHOULD NEVER STOP YES REPLIED GENZABURO I TOO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH AND SO THEY TOLD ONE ANOTHER THEIR MUTUAL GRIEFS AND FROM THAT DAY FORTH THEY CONSTANTLY MET AT SAZEN'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0049 ONE DAY AS THEY WERE FEASTING AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES IN AN UPPER STOREY IN SAZEN'S HOUSE CHOKICHI CAME TO THE HOUSE AND SAID I BEG PARDON BUT DOES ONE MASTER SAZEN LIVE HERE CERTAINLY SIR I AM SAZEN AT YOUR SERVICE

6476-57446-0051 I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WHY I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME RESPECTABLE PERSON AND YOU HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL ME THAT YOUR NAME IS CHOKICHI
6476-57446-0052 TO THINK OF SUCH A SHAMELESS VILLAIN COMING AND ASKING TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME FORSOOTH GET YOU GONE THE QUICKER THE BETTER

6476-57446-0055 THERE IS NO O KOYO HERE AND I NEVER SAW SUCH A PERSON IN MY LIFE CHOKICHI QUIETLY DREW OUT OF THE BOSOM OF HIS DRESS THE LETTER FROM SAZEN TO KIHACHI WHICH HE HAD PICKED UP A FEW DAYS BEFORE AND SHOWING IT TO SAZEN REPLIED
6476-57446-0056 AND AS HE PRETENDED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SAZEN AT HIS WITS END CRIED OUT STOP STOP

6476-57446-0059 SAZEN AFTER A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION HIT UPON A SCHEME AND ANSWERED SMILING
6476-57446-0060 YOU SHALL HAVE THE HUNDRED RIYOS YOU ASK FOR BUT AS I HAVE NOT SO MUCH MONEY BY ME AT PRESENT I WILL GO TO GENZABURO'S HOUSE AND FETCH IT IT'S GETTING DARK NOW BUT IT'S NOT VERY LATE
6476-57446-0061 SO I'LL TROUBLE YOU TO COME WITH ME AND THEN I CAN GIVE YOU THE MONEY TO NIGHT CHOKICHI CONSENTING TO THIS THE PAIR LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER NOW SAZEN WHO AS A RONIN WORE A LONG DIRK IN HIS GIRDLE
6476-57446-0062 KEPT LOOKING OUT FOR A MOMENT WHEN CHOKICHI SHOULD BE OFF HIS GUARD IN ORDER TO KILL HIM BUT CHOKICHI KEPT HIS EYES OPEN AND DID NOT GIVE SAZEN A CHANCE AT LAST CHOKICHI AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT STUMBLED AGAINST A STONE AND FELL
6476-57446-0063 AND SAZEN PROFITING BY THE CHANCE DREW HIS DIRK AND STABBED HIM IN THE SIDE AND AS CHOKICHI TAKEN BY SURPRISE TRIED TO GET UP HE CUT HIM SEVERELY OVER THE HEAD UNTIL AT LAST HE FELL DEAD
6476-57446-0064 SAZEN THEN LOOKING AROUND HIM AND SEEING TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR RETURNED HOME THE FOLLOWING DAY CHOKICHI'S BODY WAS FOUND BY THE POLICE AND WHEN THEY EXAMINED IT THEY FOUND NOTHING UPON IT SAVE A PAPER WHICH THEY READ
6476-57446-0065 AND WHICH PROVED TO BE THE VERY LETTER WHICH SAZEN HAD SENT TO KIHACHI AND WHICH CHOKICHI HAD PICKED UP THE MATTER WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE GOVERNOR AND SAZEN HAVING BEEN SUMMONED AN INVESTIGATION WAS HELD
6476-57446-0066 SAZEN CUNNING AND BOLD MURDERER AS HE WAS LOST HIS SELF POSSESSION WHEN HE SAW WHAT A FOOL HE HAD BEEN NOT TO GET BACK FROM CHOKICHI THE LETTER WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AND WHEN HE WAS PUT TO A RIGID EXAMINATION UNDER TORTURE
6476-57446-0067 CONFESSED THAT HE HAD HIDDEN O KOYO AT GENZABURO'S INSTIGATION AND THEN KILLED CHOKICHI WHO HAD FOUND OUT THE SECRET UPON THIS THE GOVERNOR AFTER CONSULTING ABOUT GENZABURO'S CASE DECIDED THAT
6476-57446-0068 AS HE HAD DISGRACED HIS POSITION AS A HATAMOTO BY CONTRACTING AN ALLIANCE WITH THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA HIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE CONFISCATED HIS FAMILY BLOTTED OUT AND HIMSELF BANISHED AS FOR KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND HIS DAUGHTER O KOYO
6476-57446-0069 AND BY HIM THEY TOO WERE BANISHED WHILE SAZEN AGAINST WHOM THE MURDER OF CHOKICHI HAD BEEN FULLY PROVED WAS EXECUTED ACCORDING TO LAW NOTE AT ASAKUSA IN YEDO THERE LIVES A MAN CALLED DANZAYEMON
6476-57446-0070 THIS MAN TRACES HIS PEDIGREE BACK TO MINAMOTO NO YORITOMO
6476-57446-0071 THE THIRTY SIXTH LAW PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS ALL WANDERING MENDICANTS SUCH AS MALE SORCERERS FEMALE DIVINERS HERMITS BLIND PEOPLE BEGGARS AND TANNERS ETAS HAVE HAD FROM OF OLD THEIR RESPECTIVE RULERS
6476-57446-0072 BE NOT DISINCLINED HOWEVER TO PUNISH ANY SUCH WHO GIVE RISE TO DISPUTES OR WHO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR OWN CLASSES AND ARE DISOBEDIENT TO EXISTING LAWS
6476-57446-0073 AND IF THEY ARE VERY POOR THEY WANDER FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WORKING AS COBBLERS MENDING OLD SHOES AND LEATHER AND SO EARN A SCANTY LIVELIHOOD BESIDES THIS THEIR DAUGHTERS AND YOUNG MARRIED WOMEN GAIN A TRIFLE AS WANDERING MINSTRELS CALLED TORIOI
6476-57446-0074 PLAYING ON THE SHAMISEN A SORT OF BANJO AND SINGING BALLADS THEY NEVER MARRY OUT OF THEIR OWN FRATERNITY BUT REMAIN APART A DESPISED AND SHUNNED RACE AT EXECUTIONS BY CRUCIFIXION
6476-57446-0075 AND BESIDES THIS THEY HAVE TO PERFORM ALL SORTS OF DEGRADING OFFICES ABOUT CRIMINALS SUCH AS CARRYING SICK PRISONERS FROM THEIR CELLS TO THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND BURYING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
6476-57446-0076 THUS THEIR RACE IS POLLUTED AND ACCURSED AND THEY ARE HATED ACCORDINGLY NOW THIS IS HOW THE ETAS CAME TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF DANZAYEMON WHEN MINAMOTO NO YORITOMO WAS YET A CHILD HIS FATHER MINAMOTO NO YOSHITOMO
6476-57446-0077 BUT KIYOMORI DESIRING TO DESTROY THE FAMILY OF YOSHITOMO ROOT AND BRANCH ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO BANDS AND SEEK OUT THE CHILDREN AT LAST THEY WERE FOUND BUT TOKIWA WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
6476-57446-0078 THAT KIYOMORI WAS INFLAMED WITH LOVE FOR HER AND DESIRED HER TO BECOME HIS OWN CONCUBINE THEN TOKIWA TOLD KIYOMORI THAT IF HE WOULD SPARE HER LITTLE ONES SHE WOULD SHARE HIS COUCH
6476-57446-0079 BUT THAT IF HE KILLED HER CHILDREN SHE WOULD DESTROY HERSELF RATHER THAN YIELD TO HIS DESIRE WHEN HE HEARD THIS KIYOMORI BEWILDERED BY THE BEAUTY OF TOKIWA SPARED THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN BUT BANISHED THEM FROM THE CAPITAL
6476-57446-0080 AND WHEN HE GREW UP AND BECAME A MAN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AFTER A WHILE YORITOMO LEFT THE PROVINCE AND WENT TO THE WARS LEAVING HIS WIFE PREGNANT AND IN DUE TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A MALE CHILD
6476-57446-0081 TO THE DELIGHT OF HER PARENTS WHO REJOICED THAT THEIR DAUGHTER SHOULD BEAR SEED TO A NOBLEMAN BUT SHE SOON FELL SICK AND DIED AND THE OLD PEOPLE TOOK CHARGE OF THE BABE AND WHEN THEY ALSO DIED THE CARE OF THE CHILD FELL TO HIS MOTHER'S KINSMEN
6476-57446-0082 AND HE GREW UP TO BE A PEASANT NOW KIYOMORI THE ENEMY OF YORITOMO HAD BEEN GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS AND YORITOMO HAD AVENGED THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER BY SLAYING MUNEMORI THE SON OF KIYOMORI AND THERE WAS PEACE THROUGHOUT THE LAND
6476-57446-0083 AND YORITOMO BECAME THE CHIEF OF ALL THE NOBLE HOUSES IN JAPAN AND FIRST ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YORITOMO HAD THUS RAISED HIMSELF TO POWER
6476-57446-0084 AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS
6476-57446-0085 SO HE SUMMONED HIM AND SAID IT IS A HARD THING TO SEE THE SON OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE LIVE AND DIE A PEASANT I WILL PROMOTE YOU TO THE RANK OF SAMURAI THEN THE PEASANT ANSWERED MY LORD
6476-57446-0086 IF I BECOME A SAMURAI AND THE RETAINER OF SOME NOBLE I SHALL NOT BE SO HAPPY AS WHEN I WAS MY OWN MASTER IF I MAY NOT REMAIN A HUSBANDMAN LET ME BE A CHIEF OVER MEN HOWEVER HUMBLE THEY MAY BE
6476-57446-0087 AND THINKING TO PUNISH THE PEASANT FOR HIS INSOLENCE SAID
