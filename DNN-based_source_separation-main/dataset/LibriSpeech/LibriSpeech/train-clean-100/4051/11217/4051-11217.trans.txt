4051-11217-0002 WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
4051-11217-0003 EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES

4051-11217-0037 THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
4051-11217-0038 THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
4051-11217-0039 THE FOUR FIERY STREAMS APPEARED TO GUSH OUT SOMEWHAT MORE PLENTIFULLY FOR THE TWO BRAZEN BULLS HAD HEARD HIS FOOT TRAMP AND WERE LIFTING UP THEIR HOT NOSES TO SNUFF THE AIR HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER

4051-11217-0041 AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
