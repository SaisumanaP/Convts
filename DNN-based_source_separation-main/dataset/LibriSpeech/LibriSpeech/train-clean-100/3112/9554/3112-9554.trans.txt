3112-9554-0006 THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HUNTING BUT HE STILL KEPT TWO HORSES FOR SUCH RIDING AS MAY BE HAD IN OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON HE CONTINUED TO RIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE LIKED THE EXERCISE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED HIM NOT TO HAVE HAD A HORSE IN HIS STABLE
3112-9554-0007 BUT HE NEVER SPOKE WILLINGLY ON HUNTING MATTERS HE HAD AT LAST RESOLVED TO GIVE UP HIS FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT AND THAT AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED THERE SHOULD BE AN END OF IT IN THE SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA
3112-9554-0008 THE JOURNEY LASTED ALTOGETHER SIXTEEN DAYS AND DURING THAT TIME MISTER AND MISSUS BURNS WERE THE HOSPITABLE ENTERTAINERS WHEN MY FATHER RETURNED HE WROTE A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HOW THE MASTIFFS WENT TO ICELAND
3112-9554-0009 THE BOOK WAS PRINTED BUT WAS INTENDED ONLY FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION EVERY DAY UNTIL HIS LAST ILLNESS MY FATHER CONTINUED HIS WORK HE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN HAPPY
3112-9554-0010 HE DEMANDED FROM HIMSELF LESS THAN HE HAD DONE TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY BUT HIS DAILY TASK WAS ALWAYS DONE I WILL MENTION NOW THE TITLES OF HIS BOOKS THAT WERE PUBLISHED AFTER THE LAST INCLUDED IN THE LIST WHICH HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN AT THE END OF THE SECOND VOLUME

3112-9554-0012 EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AYALA'S ANGEL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE DOCTOR WORTLE'S SCHOOL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE FRAU FROHMANN AND OTHER STORIES EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO
3112-9554-0013 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE HAD WRITTEN FOUR FIFTHS OF AN IRISH STORY CALLED THE LANDLEAGUERS SHORTLY ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED AND HE LEFT IN MANUSCRIPT A COMPLETED NOVEL CALLED AN OLD MAN'S LOVE
3112-9554-0014 WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY MESSRS BLACKWOOD AND SONS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MY FATHER LEFT LONDON AND WENT TO LIVE AT HARTING A VILLAGE IN SUSSEX BUT ON THE CONFINES OF HAMPSHIRE
3112-9554-0015 I THINK HE CHOSE THAT SPOT BECAUSE HE FOUND THERE A HOUSE THAT SUITED HIM AND BECAUSE OF THE PRETTINESS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HIS LAST LONG JOURNEY WAS A TRIP TO ITALY IN THE LATE WINTER AND SPRING OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE
3112-9554-0016 BUT HE WENT TO IRELAND TWICE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE WENT THERE IN MAY OF THAT YEAR AND WAS THEN ABSENT NEARLY A MONTH THIS JOURNEY DID HIM MUCH GOOD FOR HE FOUND THAT THE SOFTER ATMOSPHERE RELIEVED HIS ASTHMA
3112-9554-0017 FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN AUGUST FOLLOWING HE MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO IRELAND BUT FROM THIS JOURNEY HE DERIVED LESS BENEFIT HE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN AND WAS VERY MUCH DISTRESSED BY THE UNHAPPY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY
3112-9554-0018 FEW MEN KNEW IRELAND BETTER THAN HE DID HE HAD LIVED THERE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND HIS POST OFFICE WORK HAD TAKEN HIM INTO EVERY PART OF THE ISLAND IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE BEGAN HIS LAST NOVEL
3112-9554-0019 THE LANDLEAGUERS WHICH AS STATED ABOVE WAS UNFINISHED WHEN HE DIED THIS BOOK WAS A CAUSE OF ANXIETY TO HIM HE COULD NOT RID HIS MIND OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD A STORY ALREADY IN THE COURSE OF PUBLICATION BUT WHICH HE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED
3112-9554-0020 IN NO OTHER CASE EXCEPT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE DID MY FATHER PUBLISH EVEN THE FIRST NUMBER OF ANY NOVEL BEFORE HE HAD FULLY COMPLETED THE WHOLE TALE
3112-9554-0021 HE WAS SEIZED WITH PARALYSIS ON THE RIGHT SIDE ACCOMPANIED BY LOSS OF SPEECH
3112-9554-0022 NEARLY FIVE WEEKS FROM THE NIGHT OF HIS ATTACK I HAVE BEEN LED TO SAY THESE FEW WORDS NOT AT ALL FROM A DESIRE TO SUPPLEMENT MY FATHER'S BIOGRAPHY OF HIMSELF BUT TO MENTION THE MAIN INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS OWN RECORD
3112-9554-0023 IN WHAT I HAVE HERE SAID I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EXCEEDED HIS INSTRUCTIONS
