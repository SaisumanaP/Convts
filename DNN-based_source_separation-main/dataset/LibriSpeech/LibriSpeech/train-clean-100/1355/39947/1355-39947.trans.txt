1355-39947-0000 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY BOTH THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY THE LIFE INTERESTS OF WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
1355-39947-0001 IT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE QUESTION HOW FAR FROM THE HIGHER POINT OF VIEW OF THE SOCIAL MIND THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFORTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED OR SUPPRESSED ARE THERE ANY CONDITIONS WHICH SUGGEST SUSPICION OF OR DIRECT OPPOSITION TO SUCH CURATIVE WORK
1355-39947-0002 OF COURSE SOCIETY HAS TO BE SURE THAT NO POSSIBLE MISUSE AND DAMAGE ARE TO RESULT FROM SUCH PRACTICE FEARS IN THAT DIRECTION HAVE BEEN UTTERED REPEATEDLY BUT FROM VERY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
1355-39947-0003 ONE WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST OFTEN HEARD IN POPULAR CIRCLES RESULTS FROM AN ENTIRE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DESERVES HARDLY ANY DISCUSSION AFTER OUR DETAILED STUDY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IT IS CLAIMED THAT SUGGESTIVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF
1355-39947-0004 HYPNOTIZATION MAY BE SECRETLY MISUSED TO MAKE ANYONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AGAINST HIS WILL A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT OF THE HYPNOTIST'S INTENT OFTEN THIS IS COUPLED WITH TELEPATHIC FANCIES
1355-39947-0005 THE HYPNOTIST IS BELIEVED TO HAVE MYSTIC POWER TO BRING ANY PERSON IN A DISTANT REGION UNDER HIS MENTAL CONTROL AND THUS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT ANY SINISTER PLANS BY THE HELP OF HIS INNOCENT VICTIM ALL HYPNOTIZING THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE INTERDICTED BY THE STATE
1355-39947-0006 THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A VIEW ARE AS WE KNOW NOW ENTIRELY ABSURD WE KNOW THAT HYPNOTISM IS NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL POWER OF THE HYPNOTIZER THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FLUID IN THE SENSE OF THE OLD MESMERISM
1355-39947-0007 THE IMAGINATION OF THE HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS THE ONLY HYPNOTIZING AGENCY THUS NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR AGAINST HIS WILL THE STORY OF TELEPATHIC MYSTERIES WHICH IS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
1355-39947-0008 IS PROBABLY ALWAYS THE OUTCOME OF A DISEASED BRAIN IT IS INDEED A FREQUENT SYMPTOM IN PARANOIA AND OTHER INSANITIES THAT THE PATIENT WHO FEELS ABNORMAL ORGANIC SENSATIONS AND ABNORMAL UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSES INTERPRETS THEM AS INFLUENCES OF A DISTANT ENEMY
1355-39947-0009 WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
1355-39947-0010 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0011 BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
1355-39947-0012 THE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE BAD CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOTH ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE AND IMITATION OF THE EVIL MAY WORK WITH THE SAME MENTAL TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE THAN OTHERS ON THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT
1355-39947-0013 THEIR EXPRESSION AWAKENS CONFIDENCE THEIR VOICE AND THEIR WORDS REACH DEEPER LAYERS OF THE MIND THEIR CALMNESS AND FIRMNESS OVERWHELM MORE EASILY THE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS
1355-39947-0014 BUT THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE LIES AFTER ALL IN THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUGGESTIBILITY AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVE SUCH IMPRESSIONS THE EASILY SUGGESTIBLE PERSON CANNOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY INTERDICT HE MAY CATCH SUGGESTIONS EVERYWHERE
1355-39947-0015 ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ANY DISPLAY IN THE SHOP WINDOW MAY OVERRUN HIS OWN INTENTIONS WHAT HE NEEDS IS TRAINING IN FIRMNESS THE APPLICATION OF REENFORCED SUGGESTION OR EVEN OF HYPNOTISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS EVEN FOR HIM
1355-39947-0016 NO POSSIBLE SOURCE OF DANGER ON A HIGHER LEVEL ARE OBJECTIONS WHICH COME FROM SERIOUS QUARTERS AND WHICH ARE NOT WITHOUT SYMPATHY WITH TRUE SCIENCE IN RECENT TIMES THIS OPPOSITION HAS REPEATEDLY FOUND ELOQUENT EXPRESSION IT IS AN OBJECTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MORALITY
1355-39947-0017 BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0018 NO OTHER VIEW OF MENTAL LIFE EXCEPT THE CAUSAL ONE COULD BE IN QUESTION AS SOON AS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COMMUNITY IT BECOMES OUR DUTY TO BRING THE CAUSAL AND THE PURPOSIVE VIEW INTO HARMONY AND IT WOULD BE NARROW AND SHORT SIGHTED SIMPLY TO
1355-39947-0019 DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
1355-39947-0020 THIS OPPOSITION ARGUES AS FOLLOWS HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE BRINGS THE PATIENT UNDER THE WILL CONTROL OF THE HYPNOTIZER AND THUS DESTROYS HIS OWN FREEDOM WHATEVER THE PATIENT MAY REACH IN THE ALTERED STATES IS REACHED WITHOUT HIS OWN EFFORT WHILE HE IS THE PASSIVE RECEIVER
1355-39947-0021 HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS THEREFORE NO MORAL VALUE AND IF HE IS REALLY CURED OF HIS DRUNKENNESS OR OF HIS PERVERSE HABITS OF HIS MISUSE OF COCAINE OR OF HIS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES HE HAS LOST THE RIGHT TO BE COUNTED A MORAL AGENT IT WOULD BE BETTER
1355-39947-0022 IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
1355-39947-0023 NO ONE CAN INSIST TOO EARNESTLY THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING ONLY IF IT SERVES MORAL DUTIES AND MORAL FREEDOM AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PLEASURES AND ABSENCE OF PAIN ONLY THOSE WHO SET FORTH THIS ARGUMENT ARE ENTIRELY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
1355-39947-0024 PROFOUND EFFECT WHICH SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MAY CREATE MORE THAN THIS THEY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO GAIN A BASIS FOR THEIR ATTACK JUST BECAUSE THE HYPNOTIZER CAN ENTIRELY CHANGE THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS THE HABITS AND PERVERSITIES OF THE SUFFERING VICTIM
1355-39947-0025 HE SEEMS TO THEM A MORAL WRONGDOER WHO NEGATES THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN FREEDOM A FORCIBLE BOOK OF RECENT DAYS CALLS THE SUGGESTIVE POWER OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME IT SAYS TO THE HYPNOTIST
1355-39947-0026 BY YOUR OWN TESTIMONY YOU STAND CONVICTED OF APPLYING A PROCESS WHICH DEPRIVES YOUR SUBJECTS OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHT AND POWER OF INDIVIDUAL SELF CONTROL IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE POWER OF SELF CONTROL
1355-39947-0027 YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THAT UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE FREE CONTROL AND EXERCISE OF THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND
1355-39947-0028 YOU THEREBY ROB HIM OF THOSE POWERS UPON WHICH HE MUST DEPEND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY BUT THIS CENSURE TOO IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN NOT BECAUSE IT URGES THE PURPOSIVE VIEWS AGAINST THE CAUSAL
1355-39947-0029 BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
1355-39947-0030 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IF I HYPNOTIZE A MAN AND SUGGEST TO HIM TO TAKE UP AFTER AWAKING THE BOOK WHICH LIES ON MY TABLE HE FOLLOWS MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONFLICT AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WITHOUT FREEDOM HE FEELS A SIMPLE IMPULSE TO GO TO THE TABLE AND LIFT THE BOOK AND
1355-39947-0031 AS NO STRONGER NATURAL DESIRE AND NO MORAL OBJECTION STAND IN THE WAY HE CARRIES OUT THAT MEANINGLESS IMPULSE AND PERHAPS EVEN INVENTS A FOOLISH MOTIVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF WHY HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT BOOK
1355-39947-0032 BUT AFTER A LONG EXPERIENCE I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER A MAN WAS EVER CURED IN SUCH A WAY BY HYPNOTISM OF SERIOUS DISTURBANCES AND OF THOSE ANOMALOUS ACTIONS WHICH THE CRITICS WANT TO SEE OVERCOME BY THE PATIENT'S OWN MORAL EFFORTS ON THE CONTRARY
1355-39947-0033 EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
1355-39947-0034 IF AGAIN AND AGAIN I HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE NEW CASES IT IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE DURING THE TREATMENT TOO MUCH OF THIS DAILY AND HOURLY STRIVING AGAINST OVERPOWERING IMPULSES THE JOY OF REMOVING SOME OBSTACLES FROM THE WAY OF THE PATIENTS
1355-39947-0035 IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
1355-39947-0036 MORALITY POSTULATES THAT EVERYONE FIND CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE CAN BE VICTORIOUS IF HE PUTS HIS STRONGEST EFFORTS TO THE TASK IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE MENTAL SYMPTOMS I REPORTED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUGGESTIVE TREATMENT OF THE DRUG PASSION
1355-39947-0037 THE CASE OF A MORPHINIST TO MAKE CLEAR THIS PURPOSIVE SIDE OF THE CASE AS AGAINST THE CAUSAL ONE WHICH ALONE INTERESTED THE PHYSICIAN I MAY ADD A FEW FEATURES TO THE SHORT REPORT AS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE
1355-39947-0038 WHEN THAT MAN LEFT MY LABORATORY FOR THE LAST TIME TO GO OUT TO WORK AND HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE BELIEVED FROM HIS JOYFUL FACE THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EASY AND PLEASANT TIME IN WHICH HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE SMOOTHLY REMOVED FROM HIM THE DANGEROUS DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0039 IN TRUTH IT WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR MONTHS OF THE MOST NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A SLAVE TO HIS PASSION TO QUOTE FROM HIS LITTLE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ADDICTED TO MORPHINE
1355-39947-0040 THAT IS COMING TO ANYONE WHO IS THE USER OF OPIUM OR ANY OF ITS ALKALOIDS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I FOUND GREAT RELIEF AFTER EVERY INJECTION OF MORPHINE BUT SOON I COULD NOT GET THE SAME EASY FEELING AND COULD EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WHAT SLEEP I GOT WAS IN THE DAYTIME
1355-39947-0041 I FINALLY WENT TO THE SANITARIUM OF A DOCTOR
1355-39947-0042 WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SEE THE PROFESSOR IN THE HARVARD PSYCHOLOGICAL LABORATORY I WAS USING BETWEEN THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY EIGHT GRAINS OF MORPHINE DAILY HE PUT ME UNDER HIS TREATMENT OCTOBER SIXTH AND THAT DAY CUT ME DOWN BY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT TO NINE GRAINS A DAY OR
1355-39947-0043 THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
1355-39947-0044 THE DESIRE FOR THE DRUG WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE BUT IN ABOUT FOUR DAYS I GOT USED TO THE LOSS OF SO MUCH MORPHINE AND STAYED ON THIS AMOUNT FOR A WEEK SEEING THE PROFESSOR EVERY OTHER DAY FOR HYPNOTIC TREATMENT AND THEN RETURNING TO MY ROOM WHERE I SPENT TWENTY TWO HOURS OF THE TWENTY FOUR ON THE BED
1355-39947-0045 BUT DID NOT SLEEP MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY
1355-39947-0046 I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
1355-39947-0047 THESE REDUCTIONS OF THE DOSE WERE MADE A WEEK APART AND SOMETIMES ONLY TWO DAYS THE WORST TIME OF ALL WAS A CUT FROM FOUR INJECTIONS OF A FOURTH OF A GRAIN EACH TO FOUR OF ONE EIGHTH OF A GRAIN EACH WHICH WAS ABOUT JANUARY TENTH
1355-39947-0048 AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
1355-39947-0049 HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0050 AND FINALLY PRESENTED THE REMAINING TABLETS TO A HOSPITAL AND YET THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE LEAST CHANCE FOR HIS WINNING THIS ETHICAL VICTORY WITHOUT THE OUTER HELP OF THE HYPNOTIST WE DO NOT ELIMINATE THE MORAL WILL BUT WE REMOVE SOME UNFAIR OBSTACLES FROM ITS PATH
1355-39947-0051 WE HAVE NO MYSTIC POWER BY WHICH OUR WILL SIMPLY TAKES HOLD OF THE OTHER MAN'S WILL BUT WE INHIBIT AND SUPPRESS BY INFLUENCE ON THE IMAGINATION THOSE ABNORMAL IMPULSES WHICH RESIST THE SOUND DESIRES IF THAT WERE IMMORAL
1355-39947-0052 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0053 IF IT WERE REALLY A MORAL DEMAND THAT THE WILL BE LEFT TO ITS OWN RESOURCES AND THAT NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE COME TO STRENGTHEN ITS POWER OR REMOVE ITS HINDRANCES OR SMOOTH ITS PATH THEN WE OUGHT TO LET THE CHILDREN GROW UP AS NATURE CREATED THEM
1355-39947-0054 AND OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FROM WITHOUT BY DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING BY LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE WILLFUL IMPULSES AND THE UGLY HABITS EVEN EVERY GOOD MODEL FOR IMITATION IS SUCH A SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT AND EVERY SOLEMN APPEAL TO LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP
1355-39947-0055 TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0056 AND HE WHO BY SUGGESTION HELPS THE WEAK MIND TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES WHICH THE STRONG MIND CAN OVERTHROW FROM ITS INBORN RESOURCES WORKS FOR THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE SPIRIT OF TRUEST MORALITY MUCH MORE JUSTIFIED THAN SUCH
1355-39947-0057 ETHICAL OBJECTIONS ARE THE FEARS WHICH MOVE ENTIRELY IN THE CAUSAL SPHERE IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A METHOD WHICH HAS SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND THAT IT CAN SECURE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS AND IMPULSES WHICH THE OWN WILL OF THE PATIENT CANNOT PRODUCE
1355-39947-0058 OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED FOR ITS SKILLFUL USE TO HYPNOTIZE OR TO PERFORM ANY PERSISTENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MAY THUS BE DANGEROUS IF IT IS DONE BY THE UNFIT
1355-39947-0059 WE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE INJURIES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH POWERFUL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS THROUGH THE BEST MEANING MINISTER BUT WE CAN EXTEND THIS FEAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED MEDICINE AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
1355-39947-0060 THE POSSIBILITIES OF OVERLOOKING SYMPTOMS WHICH OUGHT TO SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OR OF ADJUSTING THE TREATMENT BADLY TO THE SPECIAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR OF IGNORING THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT BY DRUGS OR OF CREATING UNINTENTIONALLY BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0061 INJURIOUS EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS OPEN WHEN MEDICAL AMATEURS UNDERTAKE SUCH WORK CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES AND A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
1355-39947-0062 WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0063 HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE METHOD ITSELF IS UNDESIRABLE THAT HIS REAL PREPARATION OUGHT TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES WE HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE AND THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO URGE SUCH A REFORM OF THE STUDIES
1355-39947-0064 ALL THAT INVOLVES THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS SUCH IS NOT PREPARED TO ENTER INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT AND A PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC MANAGED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE
1355-39947-0065 IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
1355-39947-0066 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0067 AND THAT THE PATIENT HAS AGREED BEFOREHAND TO ALLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY HYPNOTIZATION FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AND AS A PARLOR TRICK OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS
1355-39947-0068 CRIMINAL ON SOME OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH INTEREST THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH WE HAD TO TOUCH BEFORE AND THERE IS NO NEED OF RETURNING TO THEM WITH ANY FULLNESS OF ARGUMENT WE SPOKE OF THE DANGER WHICH THE MENTAL CURES CARRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR CREED
1355-39947-0069 WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
1355-39947-0070 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1355-39947-0071 ANY ABSURD SUPERSTITION CAN BECOME ACCREDITED BECAUSE ITS CURATIVE VALUE MAY BE EQUAL TO A TRULY VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER GREATLY IF THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM BODILY SUFFERING
1355-39947-0072 HAD TO BE THE BELIEF IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF MISSUS EDDY'S SCIENCE AND HEALTH FROM A CULTURAL VIEWPOINT TOO SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MUST STAND THE HIGHER THE MORE SHARPLY IT IS SEPARATED FROM SPECIAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES
1355-39947-0073 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0074 WHO DOES NOT NEED THE STRONG RELIGIOUS REENFORCEMENT OF THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE REENFORCES INSTEAD THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE PATIENT BY SLIGHT INFLUENCES ON HIS SENSES
1355-39947-0075 EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
1355-39947-0076 THE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE STRONGLY AWARE THAT TOO MANY FACTORS OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY URGE THE CHURCH TO UNDERTAKE NON RELIGIOUS WORK SOCIAL AID AND CHARITY WORK OUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
1355-39947-0077 STILL MORE THAT IS TRUE OF THE HEALING OF THE SICK WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EXPANSION OF CHURCH ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SAPS THE VITAL STRENGTH OF RELIGION ITSELF IS INDEED A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
1355-39947-0078 THE FEAR SUGGESTS ITSELF THAT THE SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENT MAY BECOME HAMPERED THAT IN THE COMPETITION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES OF SOCIAL LIFE THE PARTICULAR CHURCH TASK MAY BE PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT THUS THE CHURCH
1355-39947-0079 IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0080 THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
1355-39947-0081 SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0082 HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0083 BOTH EDUCATORS AND CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE INDEED OFTEN RAISED SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOCIAL REFORMERS HAVE NOT SELDOM SEEN THERE WIDE PERSPECTIVES FOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN FUTURE TIMES
1355-39947-0084 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH REMODELING ACTIVITY IS GIVEN BUT AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY GRAVE MISGIVINGS OUGHT TO BE FELT WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE TREATMENT OF THE SICK
1355-39947-0085 WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0086 YES THE ARTIFICIAL REENFORCEMENT OF SUCH SPECIAL FEATURES WOULD DEPRIVE EDUCATION OF THAT WHICH IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES BY OWN ENERGY
1355-39947-0087 WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
1355-39947-0088 IN THE FORM OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND PERSUASIONS AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE LOVE AND SYMPATHY THAT HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR VERY SLIGHT ABNORMALITIES WHICH SEEM STILL WITHIN THE LIMITS WHERE THE OWN ENERGIES CAN BRING ABOUT THE CURE FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0089 I HAVE STEADILY REFUSED REQUESTS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO USE HYPNOTISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERCOMING MERELY BAD HABITS SUCH AS THE HABIT OF BITING THE NAILS A CHILD WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN STICKING SERIOUSLY TO HIS TASKS MIGHT LEARN NOW THIS
1355-39947-0090 AND NOW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS BUT HE WOULD REMAIN ENTIRELY UNTRAINED FOR MASTERING THE NEXT LESSON IN THE SAME WAY SOME NAUGHTY TRAITS MIGHT BE ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED BUT THE CHILD WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT POWER
1355-39947-0091 OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
1355-39947-0092 PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0093 WHICH ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL STILL MORE COMPLEX IS THE CRIMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY REMEDY FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL CALAMITY IF IT IS PROPOSED SIMPLY TO HYPNOTIZE THE CRIMINAL AND TO SUPPLANT HIS ANTISOCIAL WILL BY A MORAL ONE
1355-39947-0094 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1355-39947-0095 BUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BORN CRIMINAL IS ALSO ONLY A LABEL WHICH IS SUPERFICIALLY USED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MINDS THAT MEN ARE BORN WITH A BRAIN WHICH NECESSARILY PRODUCES CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS NOT INDICATED BY ANY FACTS
1355-39947-0096 THE VARIETIES WHICH NATURE REALLY PRODUCES ARE BRAINS WHICH ARE MORE LIABLE THAN OTHERS TO PRODUCE ANTISOCIAL ACTIONS WE RECOGNIZED FROM THE START THAT THE ABNORMAL MIND NEVER INTRODUCES ANY NEW ELEMENTS BUT IS CHARACTERIZED ONLY BY A CHANGE OF PROPORTIONS
1355-39947-0097 THERE IS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF A CERTAIN MENTAL PROCESS AND JUST FOR THAT REASON THERE MUST BE A STEADY AND CONTINUOUS TRANSITION FROM THE NORMAL TO THE ENTIRELY ABNORMAL
