5339-14134-0000 OF THE NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT ARRIVED IN MONKSHAVEN THE FOSTERS SHOPKEEPERS AND BANKERS HAD THE LARGEST SHARE THE MORNING SUCCEEDING THE DAY ON WHICH SYLVIA HAD ENGAGED HERSELF TO KINRAID THE FOSTERS SEEMED UNUSUALLY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN THEIR LETTERS
5339-14134-0001 SEVERAL TIMES JEREMIAH CAME OUT OF THE PARLOUR IN WHICH HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS SITTING IN EXPECTANT SILENCE AND PASSING THROUGH THE SHOP LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE MARKET PLACE IN SEARCH OF THE OLD LAME WOMAN WHO WAS CHARITABLY EMPLOYED TO DELIVER LETTERS
5339-14134-0002 AND WHO MUST HAVE BEEN LAMER THAN EVER THIS MORNING TO JUDGE FROM THE LATENESS OF HER COMING ALTHOUGH NONE BUT THE FOSTERS KNEW THE CAUSE OF THEIR IMPATIENCE FOR THEIR LETTERS YET THERE WAS SUCH TACIT SYMPATHY BETWEEN THEM AND THOSE WHOM THEY EMPLOYED
5339-14134-0003 WITH HER BASKET OF LETTERS ONE OF THESE SEEMED OF ESPECIAL CONSEQUENCE TO THE GOOD BROTHERS THEY EACH SEPARATELY LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION AND THEN AT ONE ANOTHER AND WITHOUT A WORD THEY RETURNED WITH IT UNREAD INTO THE PARLOUR SHUTTING THE DOOR AND DRAWING THE GREEN SILK CURTAIN CLOSE THE BETTER TO READ IT IN PRIVACY
5339-14134-0004 AND WERE PERHAPS AS FULL OF CONSIDERATION AS TO THE POSSIBLE CONTENTS OF THIS LONDON LETTER
5339-14134-0005 A MINUTE AGO PHILIP AND HE WERE ON A LEVEL OF IGNORANCE FROM WHICH THE FORMER WAS EVIDENTLY GOING TO BE RAISED BUT HE SOON RETURNED TO HIS USUAL STATE OF ACQUIESCENCE IN THINGS AS THEY WERE WHICH WAS PARTLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND PARTLY THE RESULT OF HIS QUAKER TRAINING
5339-14134-0006 IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
5339-14134-0007 THAT THE FOSTERS HAD FOR SOME TIME RECEIVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS WARNING THEM WITH DISTINCT MEANING THOUGH IN AMBIGUOUS TERMS AGAINST A CERTAIN SILK MANUFACTURER IN SPITALFIELDS WITH WHOM THEY HAD HAD STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS DEALINGS FOR MANY YEARS
5339-14134-0008 BUT TO WHOM THEY HAD LATTERLY ADVANCED MONEY THE LETTERS HINTED AT THE UTTER INSOLVENCY OF THIS MANUFACTURER THEY HAD URGED THEIR CORRESPONDENT TO GIVE THEM HIS NAME IN CONFIDENCE AND THIS MORNING'S LETTER HAD BROUGHT IT
5339-14134-0009 BUT THE NAME WAS TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO THEM THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO DOUBT THE REALITY OF EITHER IT OR THE ADDRESS THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS GIVEN IN FULL
5339-14134-0010 AND WAS PUBLICLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS EXCELLENT AND PHILANTHROPIC CHARACTER BUT THESE LETTERS WERE PROVOCATIVE OF ANXIETY ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MORNING'S POST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE WRITER'S FULL NAME AND VARIOUS PARTICULARS SHOWING HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF DICKINSON'S AFFAIRS
5339-14134-0011 AFTER MUCH PERPLEXED CONSULTATION JOHN HAD HIT UPON THE PLAN OF SENDING HEPBURN TO LONDON TO MAKE SECRET INQUIRIES RESPECTING THE TRUE CHARACTER AND COMMERCIAL POSITION OF THE MAN WHOSE CREDITORS NOT A MONTH AGO THEY HAD ESTEEMED IT AN HONOUR TO BE
5339-14134-0012 EVEN NOW JEREMIAH WAS ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE SO GOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD RECEIVED WOULD ALL PROVE A MISTAKE FOUNDED ON ERRONEOUS GROUNDS IF NOT A PURE INVENTION OF AN ENEMY
5339-14134-0013 AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN BROUGHT PARTIALLY TO CONSENT TO THE SENDING OF HEPBURN BY HIS BROTHER'S PLEDGING HIMSELF THAT THE REAL NATURE OF PHILIP'S ERRAND SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE SAVE THEM THREE AS ALL THIS WAS BEING REVEALED TO PHILIP HE SAT APPARENTLY UNMOVED AND SIMPLY ATTENTIVE
5339-14134-0014 IN FACT HE WAS GIVING ALL HIS MIND TO UNDERSTANDING THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE LEAVING HIS OWN FEELINGS IN THE BACKGROUND TILL HIS INTELLECT SHOULD HAVE DONE ITS WORK HE SAID LITTLE BUT WHAT HE DID SAY WAS TO THE POINT AND SATISFIED BOTH BROTHERS
5339-14134-0015 JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
5339-14134-0016 PHILIP HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING HIMSELF EMPLOYED ON A MISSION WHICH WOULD CALL OUT HIS POWERS AND YET NOT EXCEED THEM IN HIS OWN MIND HE FORESTALLED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS MASTERS AND WAS SILENTLY IN ADVANCE OF JOHN FOSTER'S PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS
5339-14134-0017 WHILE HE APPEARED TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WITH QUIET BUSINESS LIKE ATTENTION IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY NORTHWARDS TO HARTLEPOOL WHENCE HE COULD EASILY PROCEED EITHER BY LAND OR SEA TO NEWCASTLE FROM WHICH PLACE SMACKS WERE CONSTANTLY SAILING TO LONDON
5339-14134-0018 SAYING IT WAS MORE THAN HE SHOULD REQUIRE BUT THEY REPEATED WITH FRESH URGENCY THEIR WARNINGS ABOUT THE TERRIBLE HIGH PRICES OF LONDON TILL HE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO KEEP A STRICT ACCOUNT AND BRING BACK ALL THAT HE DID NOT EXPEND SINCE NOTHING BUT HIS TAKING THE WHOLE SUM WOULD SATISFY HIS EMPLOYERS
5339-14134-0019 THE LATTER WAS SILENT BROODING OVER THE CONFIDENCE WHICH PHILIP HAD APPARENTLY RECEIVED BUT WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM HE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE CULMINATING POINT OF PHILIP'S PROPOSED JOURNEY TO LONDON
5339-14134-0020 THAT GREAT CITY OF LONDON WHICH FROM ITS VERY INACCESSIBILITY FIFTY YEARS AGO LOOMED SO MAGNIFICENT THROUGH THE MIST OF MEN'S IMAGINATIONS IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT PHILIP FELT EXULTANT AT THE MERE FACT OF GOING TO LONDON BUT THEN AGAIN THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING SYLVIA
5339-14134-0021 OF NOT SEEING HER FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT NAY HE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A MONTH FOR NO RASH HURRY WAS TO MAR HIS DELICATE NEGOTIATION GNAWED AT HIS HEART
5339-14134-0022 SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY AS HE PERCEIVED COULSON'S JEALOUS SULLENNESS
5339-14134-0023 AS THEY ALL SAT AT TEA IN ALICE ROSE'S HOUSE PLACE PHILIP ANNOUNCED HIS INTENDED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0024 TO LUNNON EXCLAIMED ALICE HESTER SAID NOTHING
5339-14134-0025 SAID COULSON LUCK SAID ALICE TURNING SHARP ROUND ON HIM NIVER LET ME HEAR SUCH A VAIN WORD OUT O THY MOUTH LADDIE AGAIN IT'S THE LORD'S DOING AND LUCK'S THE DEVIL'S WAY O PUTTING IT
5339-14134-0026 NIVER FRET THYSELF MOTHER ABOUT T SHIRT SAID PHILIP IF I NEED A SHIRT
5339-14134-0027 BUT IF THAT'S THE FRAME O MIND THOU'RT IN LUNNON IS LIKE FOR TO BE A SORE PLACE O TEMPTATION THERE'S PITFALLS FOR MEN AND TRAPS FOR MONEY AT IVERY TURN AS I'VE HEERD SAY
5339-14134-0028 SAID COULSON HE'S SENT FOR
5339-14134-0029 PHILIP KNOWS SAID HESTER AND THEN SOMEHOW HER VOICE FAILED HER AND SHE STOPPED PHILIP PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS HALF UTTERED SENTENCE HE WAS EAGER TO TELL COULSON AS FAR AS HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT BETRAYING HIS MASTER'S SECRET HOW MANY DRAWBACKS THERE WERE TO HIS PROPOSED JOURNEY
5339-14134-0030 IN THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT INVOLVED AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE MONKSHAVEN HE SAID COULSON I'D GIVE A DEAL IT WERE THOU THAT WERE GOING AND NOT ME AT LEAST THERE IS MANY A TIME I'D GIVE A DEAL
5339-14134-0031 I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST
5339-14134-0032 SHE WAS PLAYING WITH HER TEASPOON BUT HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS CHOKING DOWN HER TEARS
5339-14134-0033 WHAT'S TO DO HESTER SAID HE SHE LIFTED UP THOSE EYES USUALLY SO SOFT AND SERENE NOW THEY WERE FULL OF THE LIGHT OF INDIGNATION SHINING THROUGH TEARS TO DO SHE SAID COULSON I'D THOUGHT BETTER OF THEE
5339-14134-0034 GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
5339-14134-0035 SHE HASTILY GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM
5339-14134-0036 AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
5339-14134-0037 AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
5339-14134-0038 AND ALL THE MODIFICATION ON THIS POINT WHICH HIS JUDGMENT COULD OBTAIN FROM HIS IMPETUOUS AND EXCITED HEART WAS THAT HE WOULD WATCH HER WORDS AND MANNER WELL WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING ABSENCE AND IF IN THEM HE READ THE SLIGHTEST TOKEN OF TENDER REGRETFUL FEELING
5339-14134-0039 HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
5339-14134-0040 THEY HAD SEEN HIM ALREADY OR HIS IMPULSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND AVOID THEM EVEN THOUGH ONE OF HIS PURPOSES IN GOING TO HAYTERSBANK HAD BEEN TO BID HIS UNCLE FAREWELL KINRAID TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE FROM THE HEARTY GREETING HE GAVE HIM
5339-14134-0041 AND CONVINCED OF HER GREAT LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS JEALOUSY OF PHILIP SECURE AND EXULTANT HIS BROAD HANDSOME WEATHER BRONZED FACE WAS AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO PHILIP'S LONG THOUGHTFUL SALLOW COUNTENANCE
5339-14134-0042 HE TOLD HIS UNCLE THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR LONDON THE NEXT DAY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE FOSTERS DANIEL WAS DEEPLY STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS TALKING TO A MAN SETTING OFF FOR LONDON AT A DAY'S NOTICE

5339-14134-0047 AND SAIL FOR THE NORTH SEAS DAY AFTER HE TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN TO WHISTLE AS IF HE DID NOT WISH FOR ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIS INTERROGATOR PHILIP INDEED HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO HIM HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE WANTED TO KNOW I'D LIKE TO BID GOOD BY TO SYLVIE IS SHE AT HOME HE ASKED OF HER FATHER
5339-14134-0048 SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE

5339-14134-0052 BRUNTON SELLS CHEESE AND THAT'S NO BETTER PHILIP PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST AND TO WRITE WORD TO ROBSON WHO SATISFIED WITH HIS WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION BADE HIM GO ON AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIND THE LASS
5339-14134-0053 AND SHE HAD COVERTLY WATCHED THEM UP THE BROW IN THE FIELD SHE SATE DOWN TO MEDITATE AND DREAM ABOUT HER GREAT HAPPINESS IN BEING BELOVED BY HER HERO CHARLEY KINRAID NO GLOOMY DREAD OF HIS LONG SUMMER'S ABSENCE NO FEAR OF THE COLD
5339-14134-0054 GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
5339-14134-0055 HER LIPS STILL WARM AND REDDENED BY HIS KISS WERE JUST PARTED IN A HAPPY SMILE WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING FOOTSTEP A FOOTSTEP QUITE FAMILIAR ENOUGH FOR HER TO RECOGNIZE IT AND WHICH WAS UNWELCOME NOW
5339-14134-0056 AS DISTURBING HER IN THE ONE BLESSED SUBJECT OF THOUGHT IN WHICH ALONE SHE CARED TO INDULGE WELL PHILIP AN WHAT BRINGS HERE WAS HER RATHER UNGRACIOUS GREETING WHY SYLVIE ARE YO SORRY TO SEE ME
5339-14134-0057 BUT SHE TURNED IT OFF WITH ASSUMED LIGHTNESS OH YES
5339-14134-0058 PENITENTLY AS IF ANXIOUS TO BE FORGIVEN SYLVIA DID NOT WANT HIS PENITENCE DID NOT CARE FOR HER RIBBON WAS TROUBLED BY HIS EARNESTNESS OF MANNER BUT HE KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE ONLY KNEW
5339-14134-0059 THAT SHE WHOM HE LOVED HAD ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND HE HAD NEGLECTED IT SO ANXIOUS TO BE EXCUSED AND FORGIVEN HE WENT ON WITH THE APOLOGY SHE CARED NOT TO HEAR IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN AFFAIRS LESS ENGROSSED WITH DEEP FEELING
5339-14134-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE REPROACHED HIM IF ONLY IN JEST FOR HIS CARELESSNESS AS IT WAS SHE SCARCELY TOOK IN THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS
5339-14134-0061 HE PAUSED A LITTLE SYLVIA'S GALLOPING THOUGHTS WERE PULLED SUDDENLY UP BY HIS SILENCE SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES AN AMBIGUOUS WELL
5339-14134-0062 ALMOST AS IF BESEECHING HER TO SHOW OR EXPRESS SOME SORROW AT A JOURNEY THE VERY DESTINATION OF WHICH SHOWED THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME TO LUNNON
5339-14134-0063 NOTHING MORE AS PHILIP'S INSTINCT TOLD HIM BUT HE REASONED THAT FIRST CORRECT IMPRESSION AWAY WITH INGENIOUS SOPHISTRY NOT TO LIVE THERE ONLY TO STAY FOR SOME TIME
5339-14134-0064 SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
5339-14134-0065 SHE STOOPED FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED AND CAME UP RED AS A ROSE TO BE SURE WHAT THEN AND SHE EYED HIM DEFIANTLY THOUGH IN HER HEART SHE TREMBLED SHE KNEW NOT WHY WHAT THEN
