3723-171631-0000 MINISTRANT ARS ET NATURA INSTILLANT THEY USE CORDIALS TO KEEP THE VENOM AND MALIGNITY OF THE DISEASE FROM THE HEART ELEVEN MEDITATION
3723-171631-0001 WHENCE CAN WE TAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT A CLEARER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS WORLD IS BUILT UPON OPINION OF OTHERS AND HATH IN ITSELF NO REAL BEING NOR POWER OF SUBSISTENCE
3723-171631-0002 THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
3723-171631-0003 BUT IF AN ENEMY DARE RISE UP AGAINST IT IT IS THE SOONEST ENDANGERED THE SOONEST DEFEATED OF ANY PART THE BRAIN WILL HOLD OUT LONGER THAN IT AND THE LIVER LONGER THAN THAT THEY WILL ENDURE A SIEGE
3723-171631-0004 BUT AN UNNATURAL HEAT A REBELLIOUS HEAT WILL BLOW UP THE HEART LIKE A MINE IN A MINUTE BUT HOWSOEVER SINCE THE HEART HATH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND PRIMOGENITURE AND THAT IT IS NATURE'S ELDEST SON IN US
3723-171631-0005 THE PART WHICH IS FIRST BORN TO LIFE IN MAN AND THAT THE OTHER PARTS AS YOUNGER BRETHREN AND SERVANTS IN HIS FAMILY HAVE A DEPENDANCE UPON IT IT IS REASON THAT THE PRINCIPAL CARE BE HAD OF IT
3723-171631-0006 THOUGH IT BE NOT THE STRONGEST PART AS THE ELDEST IS OFTENTIMES NOT THE STRONGEST OF THE FAMILY AND SINCE THE BRAIN AND LIVER AND HEART HOLD NOT A TRIUMVIRATE IN MAN A SOVEREIGNTY EQUALLY SHED UPON THEM ALL
3723-171631-0007 MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AS ALL PERSONS TO ALL KINDS OF SUPERIORS THOUGH OFTENTIMES THOSE PARENTS OR THOSE SUPERIORS
3723-171631-0008 THAT SERVE AND OBEY THEM THAT ARE WEAKER NEITHER DOTH THIS OBLIGATION FALL UPON US BY SECOND DICTATES OF NATURE BY CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING OUT OF NATURE OR DERIVED FROM NATURE BY DISCOURSE
3723-171631-0009 AS ALL LAWS OF PROPRIETY IN THAT WHICH WE POSSESS ARE OF THE LAW OF NATURE WHICH LAW IS TO GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN AND YET IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF NATURE THERE WAS NO PROPRIETY
3723-171631-0010 NO MEUM ET TUUM BUT AN UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY OVERALL
3723-171631-0011 WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE CARE OF OUR OWN PRESERVATION TO LOOK FIRST TO OURSELVES FOR THEREFORE DOTH THE PHYSICIAN INTERMIT THE PRESENT CARE OF BRAIN OR LIVER
3723-171631-0012 BECAUSE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY SUBSIST THOUGH THERE BE NOT A PRESENT AND A PARTICULAR CARE HAD OF THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT THEY CAN SUBSIST IF THE HEART PERISH
3723-171631-0013 AND THIS IS THE REWARD OF THE PAINS OF KINGS SOMETIMES THEY NEED THE POWER OF LAW TO BE OBEYED AND WHEN THEY SEEM TO BE OBEYED VOLUNTARILY THEY WHO DO IT DO IT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
3723-171631-0014 O HOW LITTLE A THING IS ALL THE GREATNESS OF MAN AND THROUGH HOW FALSE GLASSES DOTH HE MAKE SHIFT TO MULTIPLY IT AND MAGNIFY IT TO HIMSELF AND YET THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MISERY OF THIS KING OF MAN
3723-171631-0015 THE HEART WHICH IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE KINGS OF THIS WORLD GREAT MEN THAT THE VENOM AND POISON OF EVERY PESTILENTIAL DISEASE DIRECTS ITSELF TO THE HEART AFFECTS THAT PERNICIOUS AFFECTION
3723-171631-0016 AND THE MALIGNITY OF ILL MEN IS ALSO DIRECTED UPON THE GREATEST AND THE BEST AND NOT ONLY GREATNESS BUT GOODNESS LOSES THE VIGOUR OF BEING AN ANTIDOTE OR CORDIAL AGAINST IT
3723-171631-0017 AND AS THE NOBLEST AND MOST GENEROUS CORDIALS THAT NATURE OR ART AFFORD OR CAN PREPARE IF THEY BE OFTEN TAKEN AND MADE FAMILIAR BECOME NO CORDIALS NOR HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION
3723-171631-0018 SO THE GREATEST CORDIAL OF THE HEART PATIENCE IF IT BE MUCH EXERCISED EXALTS THE VENOM AND THE MALIGNITY OF THE ENEMY AND THE MORE WE SUFFER THE MORE WE ARE INSULTED UPON WHEN GOD HAD MADE THIS EARTH OF NOTHING
3723-171631-0019 IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0020 THAT ALL IS UNDER HIS FEET AND THE BRAIN THAT THINKS SO IS BUT EARTH HIS HIGHEST REGION THE FLESH THAT COVERS THAT IS BUT EARTH AND EVEN THE TOP OF THAT
3723-171631-0021 IS BUT A BUSH GROWING UPON THAT TURF OF EARTH HOW LITTLE OF THE WORLD IS THE EARTH AND YET THAT IS ALL THAT MAN HATH OR IS HOW LITTLE OF A MAN IS THE HEART AND YET IT IS ALL BY WHICH HE IS
3723-171631-0022 IF BEFORE HE HAD A BEING HE COULD HAVE SENSE OF THIS MISERY WOULD BUY A BEING HERE UPON THESE CONDITIONS ELEVEN EXPOSTULATION MY GOD MY GOD
3723-171631-0023 ALL THAT THOU ASKEST OF ME IS MY HEART MY SON GIVE ME THY HEART
3723-171631-0024 AS LONG AS I HAVE BUT MY HEART WILT THOU GIVE ME AN INHERITANCE A FILIATION ANY THING FOR MY HEART

3723-171631-0027 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE THAT AND SHALL I BE THY SON
3723-171631-0028 FOR GIVING THAT THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED WHO CAN KNOW IT
3723-171631-0029 THOU HAST SEARCHED SINCE AND FOUND ALL THESE GRADATIONS IN THE ILL OF OUR HEARTS THAT EVERY IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF OUR HEARTS IS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY
3723-171631-0030 AND WOULDST THOU HAVE MY HEART O GOD OF ALL LIGHT I KNOW THOU KNOWEST ALL AND IT IS THOU
3723-171631-0031 WITHOUT THEE O SOVEREIGN GOODNESS I COULD NOT KNOW HOW ILL MY HEART WERE THOU HAST DECLARED UNTO ME IN THY WORD THAT FOR ALL THIS DELUGE OF EVIL THAT HATH SURROUNDED ALL HEARTS
3723-171631-0032 YET THOU SOUGHTEST AND FOUNDEST A MAN AFTER THINE OWN HEART
3723-171631-0033 AND I CAN GATHER OUT OF THY WORD SO GOOD TESTIMONY OF THE HEARTS OF MEN AS TO FIND SINGLE HEARTS DOCILE AND APPREHENSIVE HEARTS HEARTS THAT CAN HEARTS THAT HAVE LEARNED
3723-171631-0034 WISE HEARTS IN ONE PLACE AND IN ANOTHER IN A GREAT DEGREE WISE PERFECT HEARTS STRAIGHT HEARTS NO PERVERSENESS WITHOUT AND CLEAN HEARTS NO FOULNESS WITHIN
3723-171631-0035 A HEAVINESS AND DEJECTION OF SPIRIT UPON HIM I HAVE FOUND THESE HEARTS AND A WORSE THAN THESE
3723-171631-0036 THE LAST ARE NOT HEARTS TO BE GIVEN TO THEE WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT THAT PRESENT I CANNOT BE THY SON AND I HAVE IT NOT TO THOSE OF THE FIRST KIND THOU GIVEST JOYFULNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0037 AND I HAVE NOT THAT TO THOSE OF THE OTHER KIND THOU GIVEST FAINTNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0038 IF YOU RETURN TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEARTS PREPARE YOUR HEARTS UNTO THE LORD
3723-171631-0039 IT IS A RETURNING HEART AND IF THOU SEE IT UPON THE WAY THOU WILT CARRY IT HOME NAY THE PREPARATION IS THINE TOO THIS MELTING THIS WOUNDING THIS BREAKING
3723-171631-0040 THIS CONTRITION WHICH I HAVE NOW IS THY WAY TO THY END AND THOSE DISCOMFORTS ARE FOR ALL THAT THE EARNEST OF THY SPIRIT IN MY HEART
3723-171631-0041 AND I HAVE HAD SOME DIFFIDENCE UPON THAT AND THOU HAST CLEARED A MORNING TO ME AGAIN AND MY HEART IS ALIVE DAVID'S HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE CUT OFF THE SKIRT FROM SAUL
3723-171631-0042 AND HIS HEART SMOTE HIM WHEN HE HAD NUMBERED HIS PEOPLE
3723-171631-0043 WHEN I COME TO NUMBER MY SINS BUT THAT BLOW IS NOT TO DEATH BECAUSE THOSE SINS ARE NOT TO DEATH BUT MY HEART LIVES IN THEE BUT YET AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS GREAT HOSPITAL
3723-171631-0044 THIS SICK THIS DISEASEFUL WORLD AS LONG AS I REMAIN IN THIS LEPROUS HOUSE THIS FLESH OF MINE THIS HEART THOUGH THUS PREPARED FOR THEE PREPARED BY THEE
3723-171631-0045 WILL STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE INVASION OF MALIGN AND PESTILENT VAPOURS BUT I HAVE MY CORDIALS IN THY PROMISE WHEN I SHALL KNOW THE PLAGUE OF MY HEART AND PRAY UNTO THEE IN THY HOUSE
3723-171631-0046 AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDINGS SHALL KEEP MY HEART AND MIND THROUGH CHRIST JESUS
3723-171631-0047 THOUGH THOU FILLEST ALL YET ART OTHERWISE IN SOME ROOMS THEREOF THAN IN OTHERS OTHERWISE IN THY CHURCH THAN IN MY CHAMBER AND OTHERWISE IN THY SACRAMENTS THAN IN MY PRAYERS
3723-171631-0048 SO THOUGH THOU BE ALWAYS PRESENT AND ALWAYS WORKING IN EVERY ROOM OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY YET I HUMBLY BESEECH THEE TO MANIFEST ALWAYS A MORE EFFECTUAL PRESENCE IN MY HEART
3723-171631-0049 THAN IN THE OTHER OFFICES INTO THE HOUSE OF THINE ANOINTED DISLOYAL PERSONS TRAITORS WILL COME INTO THY HOUSE THE CHURCH HYPOCRITES AND IDOLATORS WILL COME INTO SOME ROOMS OF THIS THY HOUSE MY BODY
3723-171631-0050 TEMPTATIONS WILL COME INFECTIONS WILL COME BUT BE MY HEART THY BEDCHAMBER O MY GOD AND THITHER LET THEM NOT ENTER JOB MADE A COVENANT WITH HIS EYES BUT NOT HIS MAKING OF THAT COVENANT
3723-171631-0051 BUT THY DWELLING IN HIS HEART ENABLED HIM TO KEEP THAT COVENANT THY SON HIMSELF HAD A SADNESS IN HIS SOUL TO DEATH AND HE HAD A RELUCTATION A DEPRECATION OF DEATH IN THE APPROACHES THEREOF
3723-171631-0052 BUT HE HAD HIS CORDIAL TOO YET NOT MY WILL BUT THINE BE DONE AND AS THOU HAST NOT DELIVERED US THINE ADOPTED SONS FROM THESE INFECTIOUS TEMPTATIONS
3723-171631-0053 SO NEITHER HAST THOU DELIVERED US OVER TO THEM NOR WITHHELD THY CORDIALS FROM US I WAS BAPTIZED IN THY CORDIAL WATER AGAINST ORIGINAL SIN AND I HAVE DRUNK OF THY CORDIAL BLOOD
