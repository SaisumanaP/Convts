4640-19189-0000 THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS
4640-19189-0001 STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA
4640-19189-0002 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0003 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
4640-19189-0004 THEY WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO
4640-19189-0005 OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
4640-19189-0006 HUMAN CONSCIENCE BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0008 AND THE TALONS OF A TIGER FEARFUL BEASTS WHICH WERE ABOVE MAN MAN NEVERTHELESS SPREAD HIS SNARES CONSECRATED BY INTELLIGENCE AND FINALLY CONQUERED THESE MONSTERS
4640-19189-0009 ON THE DAY WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN
4640-19189-0010 COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE
4640-19189-0011 WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
4640-19189-0012 EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN HER BREAST THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4640-19189-0013 I REVERE YOU YES YOU CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
4640-19189-0014 YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT FOR YOUR FATHER YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR VICTORY
4640-19189-0015 WHERE TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS BUT IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
4640-19189-0016 THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
4640-19189-0017 THIS PROTECTION OF ALL OVER EACH IS CALLED FRATERNITY THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF ALL THESE ASSEMBLED SOVEREIGNTIES IS CALLED SOCIETY THIS INTERSECTION BEING A JUNCTION THIS POINT IS A KNOT
4640-19189-0018 HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
4640-19189-0019 A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
4640-19189-0020 POLITICALLY IT IS ALL VOTES POSSESSED OF THE SAME WEIGHT RELIGIOUSLY IT IS ALL CONSCIENCES POSSESSED OF THE SAME RIGHT EQUALITY HAS AN ORGAN GRATUITOUS AND OBLIGATORY INSTRUCTION
4640-19189-0021 AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0022 THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS
4640-19189-0023 ARMS IN HAND AN INTERRUPTION OF CIVILIZATION DEPENDING ON A MARRIAGE OF KINGS ON A BIRTH IN HEREDITARY TYRANNIES A PARTITION OF PEOPLES BY A CONGRESS A DISMEMBERMENT BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF A DYNASTY
4640-19189-0024 FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0026 OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE
4640-19189-0027 A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028 FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0029 AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
4640-19189-0030 HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031 JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0032 LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0035 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0036 AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037 AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0038 BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
4640-19189-0039 THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040 ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0041 HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043 THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4640-19189-0044 FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
