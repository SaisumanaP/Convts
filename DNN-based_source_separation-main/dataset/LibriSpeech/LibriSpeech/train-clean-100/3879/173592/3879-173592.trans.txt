3879-173592-0022 FOR WITHIN THE PRECINCT OF FORT CAROLINE A HOMESICK SQUALID BAND DEJECTED AND WORN DRAGGED THEIR SHRUNKEN LIMBS ABOUT THE SUN SCORCHED AREA OR LAY STRETCHED IN LISTLESS WRETCHEDNESS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE BARRACKS
3879-173592-0023 SOME WERE DIGGING ROOTS IN THE FOREST OR GATHERING A KIND OF SORREL UPON THE MEADOWS IF THEY HAD HAD ANY SKILL IN HUNTING AND FISHING THE RIVER AND THE WOODS WOULD HAVE SUPPLIED THEIR NEEDS BUT IN THIS POINT AS IN OTHERS
