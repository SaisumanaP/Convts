6529-62554-0000 SO THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED BY THE SUBMARINE EXPLOSION OF THIS TORPEDO CYRUS HARDING COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS DURING THE WAR OF THE UNION HE HAD HAD OCCASION TO TRY THESE TERRIBLE ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION
6529-62554-0001 OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
6529-62554-0002 THE SPEEDY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND A TORPEDO THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED AN IRONCLAD AS EASILY AS A FISHING BOAT YES ALL WAS EXPLAINED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE PRESENCE OF THE TORPEDO IN THE WATERS OF THE CHANNEL
6529-62554-0003 AND I SAY THIS IN ORDER THAT AYRTON MAY BE ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE STRANGE EVENTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED DURING THESE TWO YEARS WHO THIS BENEFICENT STRANGER IS WHOSE INTERVENTION HAS SO FORTUNATELY FOR US BEEN MANIFESTED ON MANY OCCASIONS I CANNOT IMAGINE
6529-62554-0004 WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
6529-62554-0005 AND ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT ONLY A MAN POSSESSED OF PRODIGIOUS POWER COULD RENDER THEM AYRTON IS INDEBTED TO HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE FOR IF IT WAS THE STRANGER WHO SAVED ME FROM THE WAVES AFTER THE FALL FROM THE BALLOON
6529-62554-0006 THAT IT WAS HE WHO LIGHTED THAT FIRE ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE ISLAND WHICH PERMITTED YOU TO LAND THAT IT WAS HE WHO FIRED THAT BULLET FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE PECCARY THAT IT WAS HE WHO PLUNGED THAT TORPEDO INTO THE CHANNEL WHICH DESTROYED THE BRIG
6529-62554-0007 IN A WORD THAT ALL THOSE INEXPLICABLE EVENTS FOR WHICH WE COULD NOT ASSIGN A REASON ARE DUE TO THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING THEREFORE WHOEVER HE MAY BE WHETHER SHIPWRECKED OR EXILED ON OUR ISLAND WE SHALL BE UNGRATEFUL IF WE THINK OURSELVES FREED FROM GRATITUDE TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0008 WE HAVE CONTRACTED A DEBT AND I HOPE THAT WE SHALL ONE DAY PAY IT YOU ARE RIGHT IN SPEAKING THUS MY DEAR CYRUS REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT YES THERE IS AN ALMOST ALL POWERFUL BEING HIDDEN IN SOME PART OF THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0009 AND WHOSE INFLUENCE HAS BEEN SINGULARLY USEFUL TO OUR COLONY I WILL ADD THAT THE UNKNOWN APPEARS TO POSSESS MEANS OF ACTION WHICH BORDER ON THE SUPERNATURAL IF IN THE EVENTS OF PRACTICAL LIFE THE SUPERNATURAL WERE RECOGNIZABLE
6529-62554-0010 IS IT HE WHO IS IN SECRET COMMUNICATION WITH US BY THE WELL IN GRANITE HOUSE AND HAS HE THUS A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OUR PLANS WAS IT HE WHO THREW US THAT BOTTLE WHEN THE VESSEL MADE HER FIRST CRUISE
6529-62554-0011 WAS IT HE WHO THREW TOP OUT OF THE LAKE AND KILLED THE DUGONG WAS IT HE WHO AS EVERYTHING LEADS US TO BELIEVE SAVED YOU FROM THE WAVES AND THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ANY ONE ELSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACT IF IT WAS HE
6529-62554-0012 HE POSSESSES A POWER WHICH RENDERS HIM MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS THE REPORTER'S REASONING WAS JUST AND EVERY ONE FELT IT TO BE SO YES REJOINED CYRUS HARDING
6529-62554-0013 IF THE INTERVENTION OF A HUMAN BEING IS NOT MORE QUESTIONABLE FOR US I AGREE THAT HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL MEANS OF ACTION BEYOND THOSE POSSESSED BY HUMANITY THERE IS A MYSTERY STILL BUT IF WE DISCOVER THE MAN THE MYSTERY WILL BE DISCOVERED ALSO THE QUESTION THEN IS
6529-62554-0014 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER MY OPINION SAID PENCROFT IS THAT WHOEVER HE MAY BE HE IS A BRAVE MAN AND HE HAS MY ESTEEM BE IT SO ANSWERED HARDING BUT THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER PENCROFT
6529-62554-0015 MASTER THEN SAID NEBRASKA MY IDEA IS THAT WE MAY SEARCH AS LONG AS WE LIKE FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THAT WE SHALL NOT DISCOVER HIM TILL HE PLEASES THAT'S NOT BAD WHAT YOU SAY NEBRASKA OBSERVED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0016 I AM OF NEB'S OPINION SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT THAT IS NO REASON FOR NOT ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE WHETHER WE FIND THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING OR NOT WE SHALL AT LEAST HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0017 AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
6529-62554-0018 OF COURSE MY BOY REPLIED PENCROFT SO WOULD I AND ALL OF US I AM NOT INQUISITIVE BUT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF MY EYES TO SEE THIS INDIVIDUAL FACE TO FACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE MUST BE HANDSOME TALL STRONG WITH A SPLENDID BEARD RADIANT HAIR
6529-62554-0019 BUT PENCROFT ANSWERED SPILETT YOU ARE DESCRIBING A PICTURE OF THE CREATOR POSSIBLY MISTER SPILETT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT THAT IS HOW I IMAGINE HIM AND YOU AYRTON ASKED THE ENGINEER CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0020 YOU ARE OUR COMPANION YOU HAVE ALREADY ENDANGERED YOUR LIFE SEVERAL TIMES FOR US AND YOU AS WELL AS THE REST OUGHT TO BE CONSULTED IN THE MATTER OF ANY IMPORTANT DECISION SPEAK THEREFORE CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0021 I TOO AS YOU SAID HAVE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO PAY HIM IT WAS HE IT COULD BE ONLY HE WHO MUST HAVE COME TO TABOR ISLAND WHO FOUND THERE THE WRETCH YOU KNEW AND WHO MADE KNOWN TO YOU THAT THERE WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MAN THERE TO BE SAVED
6529-62554-0022 THEREFORE IT IS THANKS TO HIM THAT I HAVE BECOME A MAN AGAIN NO I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM THAT IS SETTLED THEN SAID CYRUS HARDING WE WILL BEGIN OUR RESEARCHES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT LEAVE A CORNER OF THE ISLAND UNEXPLORED
6529-62554-0023 WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
6529-62554-0024 BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
6529-62554-0025 AND HAPPILY THERE WAS NO WANT OF ROOM IN GRANITE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE HOUSED ALL THE TREASURES OF THE ISLAND THE PRODUCTS OF THE COLONY WERE THERE METHODICALLY ARRANGED AND IN A SAFE PLACE AS MAY BE BELIEVED SHELTERED AS MUCH FROM ANIMALS AS FROM MAN
6529-62554-0026 THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
6529-62554-0027 CONTAINING ALL THE PROVISIONS ARMS TOOLS AND SPARE UTENSILS IN A WORD ALL THE STORES OF THE COLONY AS TO THE GUNS OBTAINED FROM THE BRIG THEY WERE PRETTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE WHICH AT PENCROFT'S ENTREATY
6529-62554-0028 WERE HOISTED BY MEANS OF TACKLE AND PULLEYS RIGHT UP INTO GRANITE HOUSE EMBRASURES WERE MADE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS AND THE SHINING MUZZLES OF THE GUNS COULD SOON BE SEEN THROUGH THE GRANITE CLIFF FROM THIS HEIGHT THEY COMMANDED ALL UNION BAY
6529-62554-0029 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
6529-62554-0030 TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
6529-62554-0031 BUT THE PYROXYLE WHICH WILL NEVER FAIL US CAN THE CANNON SUPPORT THE SHOCK OF THE PYROXYLE ASKED THE REPORTER WHO WAS NOT LESS ANXIOUS THAN PENCROFT TO TRY THE ARTILLERY OF GRANITE HOUSE I BELIEVE SO HOWEVER ADDED THE ENGINEER WE WILL BE PRUDENT
6529-62554-0032 THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
6529-62554-0033 THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF POWDER USED IN THE FABRICATION OF THESE PIECES EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON EMPLOYING A METAL WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POWER OF RESISTANCE AND STEEL IS INCONTESTABLY THAT METAL OF ALL OTHERS WHICH RESISTS THE BEST
6529-62554-0034 I HAVE THEREFORE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OUR GUNS WILL BEAR WITHOUT RISK THE EXPANSION OF THE PYROXYLE GAS AND WILL GIVE EXCELLENT RESULTS WE SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL MORE CERTAIN OF THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRIED THEM ANSWERED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0035 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
6529-62554-0036 AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
6529-62554-0037 THEY WERE CHARGED WITH PYROXYLE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ITS EXPLOSIVE POWER WHICH AS HAS BEEN SAID IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF ORDINARY POWDER THE PROJECTILE TO BE FIRED WAS CYLINDROCONIC PENCROFT HOLDING THE END OF THE QUICK MATCH
6529-62554-0038 SUCH A SHOT THE HONOR OF WHICH BELONGED TO HIS DEAR BOY THE THIRD SHOT AIMED THIS TIME AT THE DOWNS FORMING THE UPPER SIDE OF UNION BAY STRUCK THE SAND AT A DISTANCE OF FOUR MILES THEN HAVING RICOCHETED WAS LOST IN THE SEA IN A CLOUD OF SPRAY
6529-62554-0039 FOR THE FOURTH PIECE CYRUS HARDING SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE CHARGE SO AS TO TRY ITS EXTREME RANGE THEN ALL STANDING ASIDE FOR FEAR OF ITS BURSTING THE MATCH WAS LIGHTED BY MEANS OF A LONG CORD
6529-62554-0040 A TREMENDOUS REPORT WAS HEARD BUT THE PIECE HAD HELD GOOD AND THE COLONISTS RUSHING TO THE WINDOWS SAW THE SHOT GRAZE THE ROCKS OF MANDIBLE CAPE NEARLY FIVE MILES FROM GRANITE HOUSE AND DISAPPEAR IN SHARK GULF
6529-62554-0041 BELIEVE ME PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT WELL SAID THE SAILOR WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH REGARD TO THOSE SIX VILLAINS WHO ARE ROAMING ABOUT THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0042 ARE WE TO LEAVE THEM TO OVERRUN OUR FORESTS OUR FIELDS OUR PLANTATIONS THESE PIRATES ARE REGULAR JAGUARS AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT NOT TO HESITATE TO TREAT THEM AS SUCH
6529-62554-0043 TURNING TO HIS COMPANION AYRTON HESITATED AT FIRST TO REPLY AND CYRUS HARDING REGRETTED THAT PENCROFT HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY PUT THIS QUESTION AND HE WAS MUCH MOVED WHEN AYRTON REPLIED IN A HUMBLE TONE
6529-62554-0044 HE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE AS ANY ONE YES SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT HIS RESERVE DOES HIM HONOR AND IT IS RIGHT TO RESPECT THE FEELING WHICH HE HAS ABOUT HIS SAD PAST CERTAINLY MISTER SPILETT ANSWERED THE SAILOR
6529-62554-0045 IS THAT YOUR OPINION PENCROFT ASKED THE ENGINEER QUITE MY OPINION AND BEFORE HUNTING THEM MERCILESSLY YOU WOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY HAD COMMITTED SOME FRESH ACT OF HOSTILITY AGAINST US
6529-62554-0046 PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
6529-62554-0047 HIS ROUGH NATURE COULD NOT ALLOW THAT THEY OUGHT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE RASCALS WHO HAD LANDED ON THE ISLAND WITH BOB HARVEY'S ACCOMPLICES THE MURDERERS OF THE CREW OF THE SPEEDY AND HE LOOKED UPON THEM AS WILD BEASTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE DESTROYED WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT REMORSE
6529-62554-0048 YOU WISH TO BE GENEROUS TO THOSE VILLAINS VERY WELL I HOPE WE MAYN'T REPENT IT WHAT DANGER SHALL WE RUN SAID HERBERT IF WE TAKE CARE TO BE ALWAYS ON OUR GUARD HUM OBSERVED THE REPORTER WHO HAD NOT GIVEN ANY DECIDED OPINION
6529-62554-0049 THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
6529-62554-0050 WELL WELL REPLIED PENCROFT WHOM NO REASONING COULD HAVE CONVINCED LET US LEAVE THESE GOOD PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T THINK ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM COME PENCROFT SAID NEBRASKA DON'T MAKE YOURSELF OUT SO BAD AS ALL THAT
6529-62554-0051 SUPPOSE ONE OF THESE UNFORTUNATE MEN WERE HERE BEFORE YOU WITHIN GOOD RANGE OF YOUR GUNS YOU WOULD NOT FIRE I WOULD FIRE ON HIM AS I WOULD ON A MAD DOG NEBRASKA REPLIED PENCROFT COLDLY PENCROFT SAID THE ENGINEER
6529-62554-0052 YOU HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN MUCH DEFERENCE TO MY ADVICE WILL YOU IN THIS MATTER YIELD TO ME I WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE CAPTAIN HARDING ANSWERED THE SAILOR WHO WAS NOT AT ALL CONVINCED VERY WELL WAIT
6529-62554-0053 AND WE WILL NOT ATTACK THEM UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED FIRST THUS THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE PIRATES WAS AGREED UPON ALTHOUGH PENCROFT AUGURED NOTHING GOOD FROM IT THEY WERE NOT TO ATTACK THEM BUT WERE TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
6529-62554-0054 AFTER ALL THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND FERTILE IF ANY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY YET REMAINED IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THESE WRETCHES MIGHT PERHAPS BE RECLAIMED WAS IT NOT THEIR INTEREST IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE
6529-62554-0055 AT ANY RATE FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE ALONE IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO WAIT THE COLONISTS WOULD NO LONGER AS BEFORE BE ABLE TO GO AND COME WITHOUT FEAR HITHERTO THEY HAD ONLY WILD BEASTS TO GUARD AGAINST
6529-62554-0056 AND NOW SIX CONVICTS OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION PERHAPS WERE ROAMING OVER THEIR ISLAND IT WAS SERIOUS CERTAINLY AND TO LESS BRAVE MEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SECURITY LOST NO MATTER
