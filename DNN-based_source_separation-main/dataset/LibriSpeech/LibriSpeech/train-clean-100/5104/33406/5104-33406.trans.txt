5104-33406-0021 ERIC LED HIS WIFE THORHILD AND HIS TWO YOUNG SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF
5104-33406-0022 FOR A WEEK OR MORE THEY STAYED IN HIS WOODS SOMETIMES IN A SECRET CAVE OF HIS WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THORGEST WAS ABOUT

5104-33406-0025 THEY TOOK HORSES AND CATTLE WITH THEM AND ALL KINDS OF TOOLS AND FOOD I DO NOT WELL KNOW WHERE THIS LAND IS ERIC SAID GUNNBIORN SAID ONLY THAT HE SAILED EAST WHEN HE CAME HOME TO ICELAND SO I WILL STEER STRAIGHT WEST
5104-33406-0026 WE SHALL SURELY FIND SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW EITHER HOW LONG WE MUST GO SO THEY SAILED THAT STRANGE OCEAN NEVER DREAMING WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD OF THEM THEY FOUND NO ISLANDS TO REST ON THEY MET HEAVY FOGS
5104-33406-0027 ONE DAY AS ERIC SAT IN THE PILOT'S SEAT HE SAID I THINK THAT I SEE ONE OF GUNNBIORN'S SHIPS OF ICE SHALL WE SAIL UP TO HER AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A CRAFT SHE IS YES SHOUTED HIS MEN
5104-33406-0028 IT SENDS OUT A COLD BREATH SAID ONE OF THE MEN THEY ALL WRAPPED THEIR CLOAKS ABOUT THEM IT IS A BIGGER BOAT THAN I EVER SAW BEFORE SAID ERIC THE WHITE MAST STANDS AS HIGH AS A HILL
5104-33406-0029 IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
5104-33406-0030 BY THOR THAT GUNNBIORN WAS A FOOLISH FELLOW WHY LOOK IT IS ONLY A PIECE OF FLOATING ICE SUCH AS WE SOMETIMES SEE FROM ICELAND IT IS NO SHIP AND THERE IS NO ONE ON IT
5104-33406-0031 HIS MEN LAUGHED AND ONE CALLED TO ANOTHER AND SAID AND YOU THOUGHT OF FROST GIANTS THEN THEY SAILED ON FOR DAYS AND DAYS THEY MET MANY OF THESE ICEBERGS ON ONE OF THEM WAS A WHITE BEAR
5104-33406-0032 YONDER IS A STRANGE PILOT ERIC LAUGHED I HAVE SEEN BEARS COME FLOATING SO TO THE NORTH SHORE OF ICELAND AN OLD MAN SAID PERHAPS THEY COME FROM THE LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND ONE DAY ERIC SAID
5104-33406-0033 IT IS CARRYING OUR SHIP AWAY FROM THIS LAND I CANNOT MAKE HEAD AGAINST IT OUT WITH THE OARS SO WITH OARS AND SAIL AND RUDDER THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE CURRENT BUT IT TOOK THE BOAT ALONG LIKE A CHIP AND AFTER A WHILE THEY PUT UP THEIR OARS AND DRIFTED
5104-33406-0034 LUCK HAS TAKEN US INTO ITS OWN HANDS ERIC LAUGHED BUT THIS IS AS GOOD A WAY AS ANOTHER SOMETIMES THEY WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE LAND
5104-33406-0035 PERHAPS THIS RIVER WILL CARRY US TO A WHIRLPOOL AND SUCK US UNDER THE MEN SAID BUT AT LAST ERIC FELT THE CURRENT LESS STRONG UNDER HIS HAND TO THE OARS AGAIN HE CALLED
5104-33406-0036 BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND NO PLACE TO GO IN STEEP BLACK WALLS SHOT UP FROM THE SEA NOTHING GREW ON THEM WHEN THE MEN LOOKED ABOVE THE CLIFFS THEY SAW A LONG LINE OF WHITE CUTTING THE SKY IT IS A LAND OF ICE
5104-33406-0037 THEY SAID THEY SAILED ON SOUTH ALL THE TIME LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO GO ASHORE I AM SICK OF THIS ENDLESS SEA THORHILD COMPLAINED BUT THIS LAND IS WORSE
5104-33406-0038 AFTER A WHILE THEY BEGAN TO SEE SMALL BAYS CUT INTO THE SHORE WITH LITTLE FLAT PATCHES OF GREEN AT THEIR SIDES THEY LANDED IN THESE PLACES AND STRETCHED AND WARMED THEMSELVES AND ATE BUT THESE SPOTS ARE ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR GRAVES
5104-33406-0039 THE MEN SAID WE CAN NOT LIVE HERE SO THEY WENT ON AGAIN ALL THE TIME THE WEATHER WAS GROWING COLDER ERIC'S PEOPLE KEPT THEMSELVES WRAPPED IN THEIR CLOAKS AND PUT SCARFS AROUND THEIR HEADS AND IT IS STILL SUMMER THORHILD SAID
5104-33406-0040 WHAT WILL IT BE IN WINTER WE MUST FIND A PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE NOW BEFORE THE WINTER COMES ON SAID ERIC WE MUST NOT FREEZE HERE SO THEY CHOSE A LITTLE SPOT WITH HILLS ABOUT IT TO KEEP OFF THE WIND
5104-33406-0041 THEY MADE A HOUSE OUT OF STONES FOR THERE WERE MANY IN THAT PLACE THEY LIVED THERE THAT WINTER THE SEA FOR A LONG WAY OUT FROM SHORE FROZE SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHITE LAND THE MEN WENT OUT UPON IT TO HUNT WHITE BEAR AND SEAL
5104-33406-0042 THEY ATE THE MEAT AND WORE THE SKINS TO KEEP THEM WARM THE HARDEST THING WAS TO GET FUEL FOR THE FIRE NO TREES GREW THERE THE MEN FOUND A LITTLE DRIFTWOOD ALONG THE SHORE
5104-33406-0043 SO THEY BURNED THE BONES AND THE FAT OF THE ANIMALS THEY KILLED IT IS A SICKENING SMELL THORHILD SAID I HAVE NOT BEEN OUT OF THIS MEAN HOUSE FOR WEEKS I AM TIRED OF THE DARKNESS AND THE SMOKE AND THE CATTLE
5104-33406-0044 AND ALL THE TIME I HEAR GREAT NOISES AS THOUGH SOME GIANT WERE BREAKING THIS LAND INTO PIECES AH CHEER UP GOOD WIFE ERIC LAUGHED I SMELL BETTER LUCK AHEAD
5104-33406-0045 ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
5104-33406-0046 FAR OFF IT LOOKS FLAT BUT WHEN YOU WALK UPON IT THERE ARE GREAT HOLES AND CRACKS WE COULD SEE NOTHING BEYOND THERE SEEMS TO BE ONLY A FRINGE OF LAND AROUND THE EDGE OF AN ISLAND OF ICE THE WINTER NIGHTS WERE VERY LONG
5104-33406-0047 SOMETIMES THE SUN SHOWED FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES IT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL FOR A WEEK THE MEN HUNTED BY THE BRIGHT SHINING OF THE MOON OR BY THE NORTHERN LIGHTS AS IT GREW WARMER
5104-33406-0048 THE ICE IN THE SEA BEGAN TO CRACK AND MOVE AND MELT AND FLOAT AWAY ERIC WAITED ONLY UNTIL THERE WAS A CLEAR PASSAGE IN THE WATER THEN HE LAUNCHED HIS BOAT AND THEY SAILED SOUTHWARD AGAIN AT LAST THEY FOUND A PLACE THAT ERIC LIKED
5104-33406-0049 HERE I WILL BUILD MY HOUSE HE SAID SO THEY DID AND LIVED THERE THAT SUMMER AND PASTURED THEIR CATTLE AND CUT HAY FOR THE WINTER AND FISHED AND HUNTED THE NEXT SPRING ERIC SAID THE LAND STRETCHES FAR NORTH
5104-33406-0050 I AM HUNGRY TO KNOW WHAT IS THERE THEN THEY ALL GOT INTO THE BOAT AGAIN AND SAILED NORTH WE CAN LEAVE NO ONE HERE ERIC HAD SAID WE CANNOT TELL WHAT MIGHT COME BETWEEN US PERHAPS GIANTS OR DRAGONS
5104-33406-0051 OR STRANGE MEN MIGHT COME OUT OF THIS INLAND ICE AND KILL OUR PEOPLE WE MUST STAY TOGETHER FARTHER NORTH THEY FOUND ONLY THE SAME BARE FROZEN COUNTRY SO AFTER A WHILE THEY SAILED BACK TO THEIR HOME AND LIVED THERE
5104-33406-0052 ONE SPRING AFTER THEY HAD BEEN IN THAT LAND FOR FOUR YEARS ERIC SAID MY EYES ARE HUNGRY FOR THE SIGHT OF MEN AND GREEN FIELDS AGAIN MY STOMACH IS SICK OF SEAL AND WHALE AND BEAR MY THROAT
5104-33406-0053 IS DRY FOR MEAD THIS IS A BARE AND COLD AND HUNGRY LAND I WILL VISIT MY FRIENDS IN ICELAND AND OUR SWORDS ARE RUSTY WITH LONG RESTING SAID HIS MEN PERHAPS WE CAN FIND PLAY FOR THEM IN ICELAND
5104-33406-0054 NOW I HAVE A PLAN ERIC SUDDENLY SAID WOULD IT NOT BE PLEASANT TO SEE OTHER FEAST HALLS AS WE SAIL ALONG THE COAST OH IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT HIS MEN SAID WELL SAID ERIC
5104-33406-0055 I AM GOING TO TRY TO BRING BACK SOME NEIGHBORS FROM ICELAND NOW WE MUST HAVE A NAME FOR OUR LAND HOW DOES GREENLAND SOUND HIS MEN LAUGHED AND SAID IT IS A VERY WHITE GREENLAND BUT MEN WILL LIKE THE SOUND OF IT
5104-33406-0056 IT IS BETTER THAN ICELAND SO ERIC AND ALL HIS PEOPLE SAILED BACK AND SPENT THE WINTER WITH HIS FRIENDS AH ERIC IT IS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR LAUGH AGAIN THEY SAID ERIC WAS AT MANY FEASTS AND SAW MANY MEN AND HE TALKED MUCH OF HIS GREENLAND
5104-33406-0057 THE SEA IS FULL OF WHALE AND SEALS AND GREAT FISH HE SAID THE LAND HAS BEAR AND REINDEER THERE ARE NO MEN THERE COME BACK WITH ME AND CHOOSE YOUR LAND
5104-33406-0058 SOME MEN WENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT FROLIC TO GO TO A NEW COUNTRY SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR IN ICELAND AND THOUGHT I CAN BE NO WORSE OFF IN GREENLAND AND PERHAPS I SHALL GROW RICH THERE AND SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY LOVED ERIC
5104-33406-0059 AND WANTED TO BE HIS NEIGHBORS SO THE NEXT SUMMER THIRTY FIVE SHIPS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN AND GOODS FOLLOWED ERIC FOR GREENLAND BUT THEY MET HEAVY STORMS AND SOME SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND THE MEN DROWNED
5104-33406-0060 OTHER MEN GREW HEARTSICK AT THE TERRIBLE STORM AND THE LONG VOYAGE AND NO SIGHT OF LAND AND THEY TURNED BACK TO ICELAND SO OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE SHIPS ONLY FIFTEEN GOT TO GREENLAND
5104-33406-0061 ONLY THE BRAVEST AND THE LUCKIEST MEN COME HERE ERIC SAID WE SHALL HAVE GOOD NEIGHBORS SOON OTHER HOUSES WERE BUILT ALONG THE FIORDS
