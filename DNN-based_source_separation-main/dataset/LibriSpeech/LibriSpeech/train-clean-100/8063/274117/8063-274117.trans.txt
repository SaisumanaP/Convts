8063-274117-0025 THE TWO BEARERS OF THE CORPSE HAD UNFASTENED THE STRAPS BY WHICH THEY CARRIED THE LITTER AND WERE LETTING THEIR BURDEN GLIDE GENTLY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE
8063-274117-0026 THE GRAVE HAVING BEEN FILLED UP THE PRIESTS TURNED AWAY AND THE GRAVE DIGGER HAVING ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO THEM FOLLOWED THEM AS THEY MOVED AWAY
8063-274117-0027 IT IS ARAMIS HIMSELF ARAMIS IN FACT REMAINED ALONE ON THAT SIDE AT LEAST FOR HARDLY HAD HE TURNED HIS HEAD WHEN A WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS AND THE RUSTLING OF HER DRESS WERE HEARD IN THE PATH CLOSE TO HIM HE IMMEDIATELY TURNED ROUND
8063-274117-0028 YES HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
8063-274117-0029 EITHER BY WAY OF ATTACK OR DEFENSE THAT THEY MUST BE CONVERSING ABOUT ANY OTHER SUBJECT THAN OF LOVE AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION THE LADY ROSE AND BOWED PROFOUNDLY TO ARAMIS
