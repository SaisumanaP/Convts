5339-14133-0000 BLACK AND BITTER BUT WELCOME ENOUGH TO THE FARMERS
5339-14133-0001 AND BELL ROBSON THOUGH NOT GETTING WORSE DID NOT MAKE ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS AMENDMENT
5339-14133-0002 OR WASHING OR CHURNING DAYS HER LIFE WAS QUIET AND MONOTONOUS ALTHOUGH HARD WORKING AND WHILE HER HANDS MECHANICALLY FOUND AND DID THEIR ACCUSTOMED LABOUR THE THOUGHTS THAT ROSE IN HER HEAD ALWAYS CENTRED ON CHARLEY KINRAID HIS WAYS HIS WORDS
5339-14133-0003 LIKE NANCY AND BORROWING THE POOR GIRL'S OWN WORDS SHE WOULD SAY SOFTLY TO HERSELF HE ONCE WAS HERE BUT ALL ALONG SHE BELIEVED IN HER HEART HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN TO HER THOUGH IT TOUCHED HER STRANGELY TO IMAGINE THE AGONIES OF FORSAKEN LOVE
5339-14133-0004 HE WAS VERY BUSY WITH FACTS AND FIGURES
5339-14133-0005 AND TO SEE SYLVIA FOR THE TWO FOSTERS WERE PUNCTILIOUSLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE THEIR SHOPMEN TEST ALL THEIR STATEMENTS INSISTING ON AN EXAMINATION OF THE STOCK AS IF HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE STRANGERS TO THE SHOP
5339-14133-0006 BY DEGREES BOTH HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE INTRODUCED TO DISTANT MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE DEALERS
5339-14133-0007 BUT THIS IT WAS EVIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE SATISFIED THEIR MASTERS WHO WERE SCRUPULOUS IN INSISTING THAT WHATEVER ADVANTAGE THERE WAS SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE YOUNGER MEN WHEN PHILIP SAW SYLVIA SHE WAS ALWAYS QUIET AND GENTLE
5339-14133-0008 PERHAPS MORE SILENT THAN SHE HAD BEEN A YEAR AGO AND SHE DID NOT ATTEND SO BRISKLY TO WHAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER SHE WAS RATHER THINNER AND PALER BUT WHATEVER CHANGE THERE WAS IN HER WAS ALWAYS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHILIP'S EYES
5339-14133-0009 SO LONG AS SHE SPOKE GRACIOUSLY TO HIM HE THOUGHT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM LONG CONTINUED ANXIETY ABOUT HER MOTHER OR THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO AND EITHER CAUSE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM TREAT HER WITH A GRAVE REGARD AND DEFERENCE WHICH HAD A REPRESSED TENDERNESS IN IT
5339-14133-0010 OF WHICH SHE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED WAS QUITE UNAWARE SHE LIKED HIM BETTER TOO THAN SHE HAD DONE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE BECAUSE HE DID NOT SHOW HER ANY OF THE EAGER ATTENTION WHICH TEASED HER THEN ALTHOUGH ITS MEANING WAS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD
5339-14133-0011 THINGS WERE MUCH IN THIS STATE WHEN THE FROST BROKE AND MILDER WEATHER SUCCEEDED THIS WAS THE TIME SO LONG LOOKED FORWARD TO BY THE INVALID AND HER FRIENDS AS FAVOURING THE DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION OF CHANGE OF AIR HER HUSBAND WAS TO TAKE HER
5339-14133-0012 TO SPEND A FORTNIGHT WITH A KINDLY NEIGHBOUR WHO LIVED NEAR THE FARM THEY HAD OCCUPIED FORTY MILES OR SO INLAND BEFORE THEY CAME TO HAYTERSBANK THE WIDOW WOMAN WAS TO COME AND STAY IN THE HOUSE TO KEEP SYLVIA COMPANY DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE
5339-14133-0013 DANIEL INDEED WAS TO RETURN HOME AFTER CONVEYING HIS WIFE TO HER DESTINATION BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE ON THE LAND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAT SYLVIA WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ALL DAY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRANGEMENT JUST MENTIONED
5339-14133-0014 AND YET THESE MUST BE REACHED BEFORE JUNE OR THE YEAR'S EXPEDITION WOULD BE OF LITTLE AVAIL EVERY BLACKSMITH'S SHOP RUNG WITH THE RHYTHMICAL CLANG OF BUSY HAMMERS BEATING OUT OLD IRON SUCH AS HORSESHOES NAILS OR STUBS INTO THE GREAT HARPOONS
5339-14133-0015 CONSCIOUS OF THE DEMAND IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT WAS WAR TIME TOO MANY CAPTAINS UNABLE TO PROCURE MEN IN MONKSHAVEN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR CREWS IN THE SHETLANDS THE SHOPS IN THE TOWN WERE EQUALLY BUSY
5339-14133-0016 STORES HAD TO BE PURCHASED BY THE WHALING MASTERS WARM CLOTHING OF ALL SORTS TO BE PROVIDED THESE WERE THE LARGER WHOLESALE ORDERS BUT MANY A MAN AND WOMAN TOO BROUGHT OUT THEIR SMALL HOARDS TO PURCHASE EXTRA COMFORTS OR PRECIOUS KEEPSAKES FOR SOME BELOVED ONE
5339-14133-0017 IT WAS THE TIME OF THE GREAT HALF YEARLY TRAFFIC OF THE PLACE ANOTHER IMPETUS WAS GIVEN TO BUSINESS WHEN THE WHALERS RETURNED IN THE AUTUMN AND THE MEN WERE FLUSH OF MONEY AND FULL OF DELIGHT AT ONCE MORE SEEING THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FRIENDS
5339-14133-0018 THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
5339-14133-0019 BUT IT THUS HAPPENED THAT THEY DID NOT GIVE THE PROMPT ASSISTANCE THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO RENDER AT SUCH TIMES AND COULSON HAD BEEN AWAY ON SOME OF THE NEW EXPEDITIONS DEVOLVING ON HIM AND PHILIP AS FUTURE PARTNERS
5339-14133-0020 ONE EVENING AFTER THE SHOP WAS CLOSED WHILE THEY WERE EXAMINING THE GOODS AND COMPARING THE SALES WITH THE ENTRIES IN THE DAY BOOK COULSON SUDDENLY INQUIRED BY THE WAY HESTER DOES THEE KNOW WHERE THE PARCEL OF BEST BANDANAS IS GONE THERE WAS FOUR LEFT AS I'M PRETTY SURE WHEN I SET OFF TO SANDSEND
5339-14133-0021 IS HE HERE AGAIN SAID PHILIP I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
5339-14133-0022 I WISH I'D SEEN HIM SAID COULSON
5339-14133-0023 WHY WHAT'S UP SAID PHILIP SURPRISED AT WILLIAM'S UNUSUAL MANNER AND AT THE SAME TIME RATHER GRATIFIED TO FIND A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN FEELINGS ABOUT KINRAID COULSON'S FACE WAS PALE WITH ANGER
5339-14133-0024 AND THEN MY MASTER SAW ANOTHER GIRL THAT HE LIKED BETTER' WILLIAM ALMOST CHOKED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP DOWN ALL APPEARANCE OF VIOLENT ANGER AND THEN WENT ON AND THAT HE PLAYED T SAME GAME WI AS I'VE HEERD TELL AND HOW DID THY SISTER TAKE IT
5339-14133-0025 SHE DIED IN A SIX MONTH SAID WILLIAM SHE FORGIVED HIM BUT IT'S BEYOND ME I THOUGHT IT WERE HIM WHEN I HEERD OF T WORK ABOUT DARLEY KINRAID AND COMING FRA NEWCASSEL WHERE ANNIE LIVED PRENTICE AND I MADE INQUIRY
5339-14133-0026 THIS FAULT OF HIS WAS ONE WITH WHICH THE TWO GRAVE SEDATE YOUNG MEN HAD NO SYMPATHY THEIR HEARTS WERE TRUE AND CONSTANT WHATEVER ELSE MIGHT BE THEIR FAILINGS AND IT IS NO NEW THING TO DAMN THE FAULTS WE HAVE NO MIND TO
5339-14133-0027 HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
5339-14133-0028 SYLVIA SAT IN THE HOUSE PLACE HER BACK TO THE LONG LOW WINDOW IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE LIGHT THE AFTERNOON HOUR AFFORDED FOR HER WORK A BASKET OF HER FATHER'S UNMENDED STOCKINGS WAS ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE BESIDE HER
5339-14133-0029 AND ONE WAS ON HER LEFT HAND WHICH SHE SUPPOSED HERSELF TO BE MENDING BUT FROM TIME TO TIME SHE MADE LONG PAUSES AND LOOKED IN THE FIRE AND YET THERE WAS BUT LITTLE MOTION OF FLAME OR LIGHT IN IT OUT OF WHICH TO CONJURE VISIONS
5339-14133-0030 IT WAS REDD UP FOR THE AFTERNOON COVERED WITH A BLACK MASS OF COAL OVER WHICH THE EQUALLY BLACK KETTLE HUNG ON THE CROOK IN THE BACK KITCHEN DOLLY REID SYLVIA'S ASSISTANT DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE CHANTED A LUGUBRIOUS DITTY BEFITTING HER CONDITION AS A WIDOW
5339-14133-0031 CHARLEY KINRAID AND THE STORY OF CRAZY NANCY HAD BEEN THE SUBJECTS FOR HER DREAMS FOR MANY A DAY AND MANY A NIGHT NOW HE STOOD THERE BRIGHT AND HANDSOME AS EVER WITH JUST THAT MUCH TIMIDITY IN HIS FACE THAT ANXIETY AS TO HIS WELCOME
5339-14133-0032 SHE DID NOT COME FORWARD TO MEET HIM SHE WENT CRIMSON TO THE VERY ROOTS OF HER HAIR BUT THAT IN THE WANING LIGHT HE COULD NOT SEE AND SHE SHOOK SO THAT SHE FELT AS IF SHE COULD HARDLY STAND BUT THE TREMOR WAS NOT VISIBLE TO HIM
5339-14133-0033 THE TONES THE LOOKS THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THOSE WORDS BUT ALL SHE SAID WAS I DIDN'T THINK TO SEE YO
5339-14133-0034 SHE FELT HIS EYES WERE UPON HER WATCHING EVERY MOTION AND GREW MORE AND MORE CONFUSED IN HER EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOUR HE WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THE NATURE OF HIS RECEPTION AND WAS NOT SURE AT FIRST WHETHER TO TAKE THE GREAT CHANGE IN HER MANNER
5339-14133-0035 AS A FAVOURABLE SYMPTOM OR OTHERWISE BY AND BY LUCKILY FOR HIM IN SOME TURN OF HER ARM TO REACH THE SCISSORS ON THE TABLE SHE CAUGHT THE EDGE OF HER WORK BASKET AND DOWN IT FELL SHE STOOPED TO PICK UP THE SCATTERED STOCKINGS AND BALL OF WORSTED
5339-14133-0036 AND SO DID HE AND WHEN THEY ROSE UP HE HAD FAST HOLD OF HER HAND AND HER FACE WAS TURNED AWAY HALF READY TO CRY
5339-14133-0037 YO MIGHT HA FORGOTTEN ME AND YET I THOUGHT WE MADE A BARGAIN AGAINST FORGETTING EACH OTHER NO ANSWER HE WENT ON YO'VE NEVER BEEN OUT O MY THOUGHTS SYLVIA ROBSON
5339-14133-0038 AND I'VE BEEN NEAR NEITHER KITH NOR KIN AS YET AND NOW I'M HERE YOU WON'T SPEAK TO ME I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
5339-14133-0039 TILL I'D TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ME MORE BUT IF SHE'S A COLD HEART AND CANNOT CARE FOR A HONEST SAILOR WHY THEN I'D BEST GO BACK AT ONCE HE MADE FOR THE DOOR HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY SURE FROM SOME SIGN OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT IT TO HER WOMANLY PRIDE TO GIVE WAY
5339-14133-0040 HE HAD NOT TAKEN TWO STEPS WHEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING
5339-14133-0041 AND THEN THEY SAT DOWN ON THE SETTLE TOGETHER AND WHEN SHE WAS MORE COMPOSED THEY BEGAN TO TALK HE ASKED HER ABOUT HER MOTHER NOT SORRY IN HIS HEART AT BELL ROBSON'S ABSENCE
5339-14133-0042 HE HAD INTENDED IF NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WISHES AND DESIRES WITH REGARD TO SYLVIA TO HER PARENTS BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE WAS NOT SORRY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
5339-14133-0043 HAD GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND OBTAINING HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO TELL EITHER HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER AT PRESENT I HA SPENT MY MONEY PRETTY FREE HE SAID AND I'VE NE'ER A PENNY TO THE FORE
5339-14133-0044 AND YO'R PARENTS MAY LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER FOR YO MY PRETTY
5339-14133-0045 I SHALL GO TO SEA HAPPY NOW THINKING I'VE YO'R WORD YO'RE NOT ONE TO GO BACK FROM IT I'M SURE ELSE IT'S A LONG TIME TO LEAVE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL AS YO AND NE'ER A CHANCE OF A LETTER REACHING YO JUST TO TELL YO ONCE AGAIN HOW I LOVE YO
5339-14133-0046 THERE'LL BE NO NEED O THAT MURMURED SYLVIA SHE WAS TOO DIZZY WITH HAPPINESS TO HAVE ATTENDED MUCH TO HIS DETAILS OF HIS WORLDLY PROSPECTS BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS TENDER WORDS OF LOVE HER EAGER HEART WAS READY TO LISTEN I DON'T KNOW
5339-14133-0047 AND THERE'S YON TALL FELLOW OF A COUSIN AS LOOKS BLACK AT ME
5339-14133-0048 HE'S A NOTION OF BEING SWEET ON YO HISSELF NOT HE SAID SYLVIA WITH SOME CONTEMPT IN HER TONE
5339-14133-0049 BUT SHE WEARY OF A SUBJECT SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT AND EAGER TO IDENTIFY HERSELF WITH ALL HIS INTERESTS ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS PLANS ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS AND THEY WENT ON AS LOVERS DO
5339-14133-0050 AT ANY RATE IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME HE LIKED KINRAID AND HAD STRONG SYMPATHY NOT MERELY WITH WHAT HE KNEW OF THE YOUNG SAILOR'S CHARACTER BUT WITH THE LIFE HE LED AND THE BUSINESS HE FOLLOWED
5339-14133-0051 ROBSON LISTENED TO ALL HE SAID WITH APPROVING NODS AND WINKS TILL CHARLEY HAD TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HE HAD TO SAY AND THEN HE TURNED AND STRUCK HIS BROAD HORNY PALM INTO KINRAID'S AS IF CONCLUDING A BARGAIN
5339-14133-0052 HE WOUND UP WITH A CHUCKLE AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM THAT THIS GREAT PIECE OF BUSINESS OF DISPOSING OF THEIR ONLY CHILD HAD BEEN CONCLUDED WHILE HIS WIFE WAS AWAY
5339-14133-0053 MISCHIEF ONLY KNOWS BUT SHE'S NOAN KEEN ON MATTERIMONY
5339-14133-0054 WE'N BEST KEEP THIS MATTER TO OURSELVES TILL THOU COMES INT PORT AGAIN
5339-14133-0055 AN OUD MAN LIKE ME ISN'T AS GOOD COMPANY AS A PRETTY LASS LAUGHING A LOW RICH LAUGH OVER HIS OWN WIT DANIEL WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED SYLVIE
5339-14133-0056 FOR A TIME THERE WAS NO ANSWER THEN A DOOR WAS UNBOLTED AND SYLVIA SAID I CAN'T COME DOWN AGAIN
