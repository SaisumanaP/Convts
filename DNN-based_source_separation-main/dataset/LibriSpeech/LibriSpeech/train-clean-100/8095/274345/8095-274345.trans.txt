8095-274345-0000 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002 UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0003 HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
8095-274345-0004 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005 THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0006 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0007 THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0009 AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
8095-274345-0010 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0012 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0015 HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
8095-274345-0016 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017 AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0018 THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
8095-274345-0019 SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
8095-274345-0020 THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0021 AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
8095-274345-0022 WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
8095-274345-0023 ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
8095-274345-0024 IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
8095-274345-0025 AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
8095-274345-0026 THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
8095-274345-0027 THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
8095-274345-0028 AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
8095-274345-0029 SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
8095-274345-0030 OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY
8095-274345-0031 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0032 IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
8095-274345-0033 MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8095-274345-0034 THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
