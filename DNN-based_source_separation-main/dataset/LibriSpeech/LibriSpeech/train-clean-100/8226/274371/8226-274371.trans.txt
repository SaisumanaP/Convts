8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0005 IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
8226-274371-0006 WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
8226-274371-0007 ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
8226-274371-0008 HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
8226-274371-0009 AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010 GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0011 AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
8226-274371-0012 AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
8226-274371-0013 THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0014 THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
8226-274371-0015 WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0016 WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0017 THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED
8226-274371-0018 MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
8226-274371-0019 WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
8226-274371-0020 AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE
8226-274371-0021 NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
8226-274371-0022 AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
8226-274371-0023 LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
8226-274371-0024 WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN
8226-274371-0025 BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0026 TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED
8226-274371-0027 MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
8226-274371-0028 UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
8226-274371-0029 WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD HE SHUT THE GATES AND REFUSED TO RECEIVE THE KING
8226-274371-0030 WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
8226-274371-0031 THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
8226-274371-0032 THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
8226-274371-0033 WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
8226-274371-0034 AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
8226-274371-0035 THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BRINGING IN LOANS OF MONEY AND PLATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FORCES WHICH SHOULD DEFEND THE KING AND BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR THIS STYLE THEY STILL PRESERVED WITHIN TEN DAYS
8226-274371-0036 AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0037 NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0038 THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0040 IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
8226-274371-0041 THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
8226-274371-0042 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8226-274371-0043 HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
8226-274371-0044 AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
8226-274371-0045 THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
8226-274371-0046 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT

8226-274371-0051 THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
8226-274371-0052 BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
8226-274371-0053 AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
