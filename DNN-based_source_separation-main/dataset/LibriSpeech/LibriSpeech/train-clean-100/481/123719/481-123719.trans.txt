481-123719-0000 IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
481-123719-0001 I GREW USED TO EVERYTHING OR RATHER I VOLUNTARILY RESIGNED MYSELF TO ENDURING IT BUT I HAD A MEANS OF ESCAPE THAT RECONCILED EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO FIND REFUGE IN THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL IN DREAMS OF COURSE
481-123719-0002 I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
481-123719-0003 PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
481-123719-0004 BEFORE ME THEN WHAT WERE MY DREAMS
481-123719-0005 THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
481-123719-0006 THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
481-123719-0007 BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
481-123719-0008 BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
481-123719-0009 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0010 THAT WAS MY RUIN FOR WHEN I WAS IN THE MUD I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AT OTHER TIMES I WAS A HERO AND THE HERO WAS A CLOAK FOR THE MUD
481-123719-0011 IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
481-123719-0012 BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
481-123719-0013 AND WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY PRESENT TO SERVE AS AN APPETISING SAUCE THAT SAUCE WAS MADE UP OF CONTRADICTIONS AND SUFFERINGS OF AGONISING INWARD ANALYSIS AND ALL THESE PANGS AND PIN PRICKS GAVE A CERTAIN PIQUANCY
481-123719-0014 EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
481-123719-0015 AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
481-123719-0016 INTO THE STREET NO I HAD A LOFTY WAY OF GETTING OUT OF IT ALL
481-123719-0017 IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
481-123719-0018 EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
481-123719-0019 I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
481-123719-0020 MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
481-123719-0021 AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
481-123719-0022 LAKE COMO BEING FOR THAT PURPOSE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ROME THEN WOULD COME A SCENE IN THE BUSHES AND SO ON AND SO ON AS THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ALL ABOUT IT YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE TO DRAG ALL THIS INTO PUBLIC
481-123719-0023 BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
481-123719-0024 AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
481-123719-0025 AND EVEN MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THAN THAT IS MY MAKING THIS REMARK NOW BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
481-123719-0026 I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
481-123719-0027 TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
481-123719-0028 THAT IT BECAME ESSENTIAL AT ONCE TO EMBRACE MY FELLOWS AND ALL MANKIND AND FOR THAT PURPOSE I NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUMAN BEING ACTUALLY EXISTING I HAD TO CALL ON ANTON ANTONITCH HOWEVER ON TUESDAY
481-123719-0029 HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
481-123719-0030 ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0031 THEY BOTH HAD SNUB NOSES AND I WAS AWFULLY SHY OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE ALWAYS WHISPERING AND GIGGLING TOGETHER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE USUALLY SAT IN HIS STUDY ON A LEATHER COUCH IN FRONT OF THE TABLE WITH SOME GREY HEADED GENTLEMAN
481-123719-0032 USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
481-123719-0033 AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
481-123719-0034 LISTENING TO THEM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY TO THEM OR VENTURING TO SAY A WORD I BECAME STUPEFIED SEVERAL TIMES I FELT MYSELF PERSPIRING I WAS OVERCOME BY A SORT OF PARALYSIS BUT THIS WAS PLEASANT AND GOOD FOR ME
481-123719-0035 ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
481-123719-0036 BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
481-123719-0037 CURSES ON THAT SCHOOL AND ALL THOSE TERRIBLE YEARS OF PENAL SERVITUDE IN SHORT I PARTED FROM MY SCHOOLFELLOWS AS SOON AS I GOT OUT INTO THE WORLD THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LEFT TO WHOM I NODDED IN THE STREET ONE OF THEM WAS SIMONOV
481-123719-0038 WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
481-123719-0039 BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
481-123719-0040 NOT BEING QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
481-123719-0041 BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
