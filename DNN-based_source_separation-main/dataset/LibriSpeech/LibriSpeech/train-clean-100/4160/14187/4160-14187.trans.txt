4160-14187-0000 I WAS BURNING WITH IMPATIENCE TO IMPART MY NEWS TO HIM AND THIS FACT TOGETHER WITH THE GHOSTLY PROCEEDINGS OF POLTON WORKED ME UP TO A STATE OF NERVOUS TENSION THAT RENDERED EITHER REST OR THOUGHT EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE LAMP BELOW GLARING REDLY THROUGH THE FOG
4160-14187-0001 AT THIS MOMENT POLTON MADE A SILENT APPEARANCE ON THE STAIRS LEADING FROM THE LABORATORY GIVING ME QUITE A START AND I WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE INTO THE ROOM WHEN MY EAR CAUGHT THE TINKLE OF A HANSOM APPROACHING FROM PAPER BUILDINGS
4160-14187-0002 THE VEHICLE DREW NEARER AND AT LENGTH STOPPED OPPOSITE THE HOUSE ON WHICH POLTON SLID DOWN THE STAIRS WITH THE AGILITY OF A HARLEQUIN A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HIS VOICE ASCENDING FROM THE HALL I DO HOPE SIR YOU'RE NOT MUCH HURT
4160-14187-0003 THOUGH VERY DISREPUTABLE TO LOOK AT JUST CAME A CROPPER IN THE MUD JERVIS HE ADDED AS HE NOTED MY DISMAYED EXPRESSION DINNER AND A CLOTHES BRUSH ARE WHAT I CHIEFLY NEED NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED VERY PALE AND SHAKEN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE LIGHT ON THE LANDING
4160-14187-0004 AND HE SANK INTO HIS EASY CHAIR IN THE LIMP MANNER OF A MAN EITHER VERY WEAK OR VERY FATIGUED HOW DID IT HAPPEN I ASKED WHEN POLTON HAD CREPT AWAY ON TIP TOE TO MAKE READY FOR DINNER THORNDYKE LOOKED ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS HENCHMAN HAD DEPARTED AND SAID
4160-14187-0005 A QUEER AFFAIR JERVIS A VERY ODD AFFAIR INDEED I WAS COMING UP FROM THE BOROUGH PICKING MY WAY MIGHTY CAREFULLY ACROSS THE ROAD ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREASY SLIPPERY MUD AND HAD JUST REACHED THE FOOT OF LONDON BRIDGE WHEN I HEARD A HEAVY LORRY COMING DOWN THE SLOPE A GOOD DEAL TOO FAST
4160-14187-0006 THE HORSES CAME STAMPING AND SLIDING STRAIGHT ON TO ME AND BEFORE I COULD WRIGGLE OUT OF THE WAY THE HOOF OF ONE OF THEM SMASHED IN MY HAT THAT WAS A NEW ONE THAT I CAME HOME IN AND HALF STUNNED ME THEN THE NEAR WHEEL STRUCK MY HEAD MAKING A DIRTY LITTLE SCALP WOUND AND PINNED DOWN MY SLEEVE SO THAT I COULDN'T PULL AWAY MY ARM
4160-14187-0007 YES I WENT INTO DRY DOCK IN THE O P ROOM AND THEN OLD LANGDALE INSISTED ON MY LYING DOWN FOR AN HOUR OR SO IN CASE ANY SYMPTOMS OF CONCUSSION SHOULD APPEAR BUT I WAS ONLY A TRIFLE SHAKEN AND CONFUSED STILL IT WAS A QUEER AFFAIR YOU MEAN THE MAN PUSHING YOU DOWN IN THAT WAY
4160-14187-0008 YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL SURELY I SAID NO OF COURSE NOT HE REPLIED BUT WITHOUT MUCH CONVICTION AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO PURSUE THE MATTER WHEN POLTON REAPPEARED AND MY FRIEND ABRUPTLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT AFTER DINNER I RECOUNTED MY CONVERSATION WITH WALTER HORNBY
4160-14187-0009 WATCHING MY COLLEAGUE'S FACE WITH SOME EAGERNESS TO SEE WHAT EFFECT THIS NEW INFORMATION WOULD PRODUCE ON HIM THE RESULT WAS ON THE WHOLE DISAPPOINTING HE WAS INTERESTED KEENLY INTERESTED BUT SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF EXCITEMENT
4160-14187-0010 SO JOHN HORNBY HAS BEEN PLUNGING IN MINES EH HE SAID WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER AT HIS AGE DID YOU LEARN HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN IN DIFFICULTIES NO BUT IT CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN QUITE SUDDEN AND UNFORESEEN I SHOULD THINK NOT THORNDYKE AGREED
4160-14187-0011 IN WHICH CASE THE DEPRECIATION WOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED HIM IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT MIGHT HAVE A CONSIDERABLE BEARING ON THE PRESENT CASE MIGHT IT NOT UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THORNDYKE IT MIGHT BEAR ON THE CASE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
4160-14187-0012 THAT IS WELL CONSIDERED SAID MY COLLEAGUE BUT WHAT IS THE SPECIAL BEARING ON THE CASE SUPPOSING IT WAS SO ON THE SUPPOSITION I REPLIED THAT MISTER HORNBY WAS IN ACTUAL PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES AT THE DATE OF THE ROBBERY IT SEEMS TO ME POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A HYPOTHESIS
4160-14187-0013 IN FACT IT IS ALMOST FANTASTIC NEVER MIND THAT SAID HE A SOUND THINKER GIVES EQUAL CONSIDERATION TO THE PROBABLE AND THE IMPROBABLE THUS ENCOURAGED I PROCEEDED TO SET FORTH THE THEORY OF THE CRIME AS IT HAD OCCURRED TO ME ON MY WAY HOME IN THE FOG
4160-14187-0014 AND I WAS GRATIFIED TO OBSERVE THE CLOSE ATTENTION WITH WHICH THORNDYKE LISTENED AND HIS LITTLE NODS OF APPROVAL AT EACH POINT THAT I MADE WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME TIME LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY INTO THE FIRE AND EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING HOW MY THEORY AND THE NEW FACTS ON WHICH IT WAS BASED
4160-14187-0015 REALLY ADDS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE DULLEST MIND CAN PERCEIVE THE OBVIOUS AS FOR INSTANCE THE IMPORTANCE OF A FINGER PRINT YOU HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT THING AND I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOU HAVE EMANCIPATED YOURSELF AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT
4160-14187-0016 FROM THE GREAT FINGER PRINT OBSESSION WHICH HAS POSSESSED THE LEGAL MIND EVER SINCE GALTON PUBLISHED HIS EPOCH MAKING MONOGRAPH IN THAT WORK I REMEMBER HE STATES THAT A FINGER PRINT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION A MOST DANGEROUS AND MISLEADING STATEMENT
4160-14187-0017 WHICH HAS BEEN FASTENED UPON EAGERLY BY THE POLICE WHO HAVE NATURALLY BEEN DELIGHTED AT OBTAINING A SORT OF MAGIC TOUCHSTONE BY WHICH THEY ARE SAVED THE LABOUR OF INVESTIGATION BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SINGLE FACT THAT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION
4160-14187-0018 AS WELL MIGHT ONE EXPECT TO MAKE A SYLLOGISM WITH A SINGLE PREMISE I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD HARDLY GO SO FAR AS THAT I SAID LAUGHING NO HE ADMITTED BUT THE KIND OF SYLLOGISM THAT THEY DO MAKE IS THIS THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT
4160-14187-0019 WAS THE CRIME COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT THAT IS WHERE THE CORROBORATION IS REQUIRED THAT PRACTICALLY LEAVES THE CASE TO BE INVESTIGATED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE FINGER PRINT WHICH THUS BECOMES OF NO IMPORTANCE NOT AT ALL REJOINED THORNDYKE
4160-14187-0020 THE FINGER PRINT IS A MOST VALUABLE CLUE AS LONG AS ITS EVIDENTIAL VALUE IS NOT EXAGGERATED TAKE OUR PRESENT CASE FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT THE THUMB PRINT THE ROBBERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ANYBODY THERE IS NO CLUE WHATEVER
4160-14187-0021 QUITE REPLIED THORNDYKE I HAVE ENTERTAINED IT FROM THE FIRST AND THE NEW FACTS THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED INCREASE ITS PROBABILITY YOU REMEMBER I SAID THAT FOUR HYPOTHESES WERE POSSIBLE THAT THE ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED EITHER BY REUBEN BY WALTER BY JOHN HORNBY OR BY SOME OTHER PERSON
4160-14187-0022 NOW PUTTING ASIDE THE SOME OTHER PERSON FOR CONSIDERATION ONLY IF THE FIRST THREE HYPOTHESES FAIL WE HAVE LEFT REUBEN WALTER AND JOHN BUT IF WE LEAVE THE THUMB PRINT OUT OF THE QUESTION THE PROBABILITIES EVIDENTLY POINT TO JOHN HORNBY
4160-14187-0023 SINCE HE ADMITTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS WHEREAS THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT THE OTHERS HAD THE THUMB PRINT HOWEVER TRANSFERS THE SUSPICION TO REUBEN BUT YET AS YOUR THEORY MAKES EVIDENT IT DOES NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR JOHN HORNBY
4160-14187-0024 AS THE CASE STANDS THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES MAY BE STATED THUS JOHN HORNBY UNDOUBTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THEM BUT IF THE THUMB MARK WAS MADE AFTER HE CLOSED THE SAFE AND BEFORE HE OPENED IT AGAIN
4160-14187-0025 BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCESS TO THEM AND IF HE HAD NOT HE COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE THUMB MARK IN THE MANNER AND AT THE TIME STATED BUT JOHN HORNBY MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE PREVIOUSLY MADE THUMB MARK OF REUBEN AND MAY POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED IT IN WHICH CASE HE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE THIEF
4160-14187-0026 AS TO WALTER HORNBY HE MAY HAVE HAD THE MEANS OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCESS EITHER TO THE DIAMONDS OR TO MISTER HORNBY'S MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4160-14187-0027 THE ACTUAL POINTS AT ISSUE THEN I SAID ARE WHETHER REUBEN HAD ANY MEANS OF OPENING THE SAFE AND WHETHER MISTER HORNBY EVER DID ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK IN BLOOD ON HIS MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4160-14187-0028 YES REPLIED THORNDYKE THOSE ARE THE POINTS WITH SOME OTHERS AND THEY ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN UNSETTLED REUBEN'S ROOMS HAVE BEEN SEARCHED BY THE POLICE WHO FAILED TO FIND ANY SKELETON OR DUPLICATE KEYS BUT THIS PROVES NOTHING AS HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE MADE AWAY WITH THEM WHEN HE HEARD OF THE THUMB MARK BEING FOUND
