1743-142912-0000 AND NOW OUR FAMILY IS VERY WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OLD ORCHARD SAID CHEBEC PROUDLY SLOWLY PETER REACHED OVER HIS BACK WITH HIS LONG LEFT HIND FOOT AND THOUGHTFULLY SCRATCHED HIS LONG RIGHT EAR
1743-142912-0001 HE DIDN'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT HE COULDN'T RECALL THOSE TWO COUSINS OF CHEBEC'S DID YOU SAY YOUR FIGHTING COUSIN HE ASKED IN A HESITATING WAY THAT'S WHAT I SAID REPLIED CHEBEC HE IS SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW
1743-142912-0002 THE REST OF US ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WHEN HE IS ABOUT OF COURSE I KNOW HIM DECLARED PETER HIS FACE CLEARING WHERE IS HE NOW
1743-142912-0003 AT THAT VERY INSTANT A GREAT RACKET BROKE OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OLD ORCHARD AND IN NO TIME AT ALL THE FEATHERED FOLKS WERE HURRYING FROM EVERY DIRECTION SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
1743-142912-0004 OF COURSE PETER COULDN'T BE LEFT OUT OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE SCAMPERED FOR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
1743-142912-0005 AND THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AS IF TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY FOR A MINUTE PETER COULDN'T THINK WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH REDTAIL AND THEN HE SAW
1743-142912-0006 A WHITE THROATED WHITE BREASTED BIRD HAVING A BLACK CAP AND BACK AND A BROAD WHITE BAND ACROSS THE END OF HIS TAIL WAS DARTING AT REDTAIL AS IF HE MEANT TO PULL OUT EVERY FEATHER IN THE LATTER'S COAT
1743-142912-0007 HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIM REDTAIL WAS A PERFECT GIANT BUT THIS SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SCRAPPER FOR THAT IS WHO IT WAS
1743-142912-0008 HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
1743-142912-0009 ALL THE OTHER BIRDS JOINED HIM IN CALLING REDTAIL BAD NAMES BUT NONE NOT EVEN BULLY THE ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO JOIN HIM IN ATTACKING BIG REDTAIL WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING REDTAIL FAR ENOUGH FROM THE OLD ORCHARD TO SUIT HIM
1743-142912-0010 SCRAPPER FLEW BACK AND PERCHED ON A DEAD BRANCH OF ONE OF THE TREES WHERE HE RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATIONS OF ALL HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS HE TOOK THEM QUITE MODESTLY ASSURING THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING
1743-142912-0011 PETER COULDN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE SCRAPPER FOR HIS COURAGE AS PETER LOOKED UP AT SCRAPPER HE SAW THAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE FLYCATCHERS THERE WAS JUST THE TINIEST OF HOOKS ON THE END OF HIS BILL
1743-142912-0012 SCRAPPER'S SLIGHTLY RAISED CAP SEEMED ALL BLACK BUT IF PETER COULD HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE ENOUGH HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT HIDDEN IN IT WAS A PATCH OF ORANGE RED WHILE PETER SAT STARING UP AT HIM SCRAPPER SUDDENLY DARTED OUT INTO THE AIR
1743-142912-0013 AND HIS BILL SNAPPED IN QUITE THE SAME WAY CHEBEC'S DID WHEN HE CAUGHT A FLY BUT IT WASN'T A FLY THAT SCRAPPER HAD IT WAS A BEE PETER SAW IT VERY DISTINCTLY JUST AS SCRAPPER SNAPPED IT UP
1743-142912-0014 IT REMINDED PETER THAT HE HAD OFTEN HEARD SCRAPPER CALLED THE BEE MARTIN AND NOW HE UNDERSTOOD WHY DO YOU LIVE ON BEES ALTOGETHER ASKED PETER
1743-142912-0015 THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HONEY IF I DID
1743-142912-0016 THOSE THAT I DO CATCH ARE MOSTLY DRONES AND YOU KNOW THE DRONES ARE USELESS THEY DO NO WORK AT ALL IT IS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT I NOW AND THEN CATCH A WORKER I EAT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT FLY AND SOME THAT DON'T
1743-142912-0017 I'M ONE OF FARMER BROWN'S BEST FRIENDS IF HE DID BUT KNOW IT YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU PLEASE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY BUT IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS BETTER EYESIGHT THAN I HAVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT IS
1743-142912-0018 THERE'S A FLY WAY OVER THERE BEYOND THAT OLD APPLE TREE WATCH ME CATCH IT PETER KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE ANY EFFORT TRYING TO SEE THAT FLY HE KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT HAD IT BEEN ONLY ONE FOURTH THAT DISTANCE AWAY
1743-142912-0019 BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
1743-142912-0020 ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD IN THE OLD ORCHARD THIS YEAR ASKED PETER OF COURSE I AM DECLARED SCRAPPER I JUST THEN HE SPIED BLACKY THE CROW AND DASHED OUT TO MEET HIM
1743-142912-0021 TURNING AWAY TOWARD THE GREEN MEADOWS INSTEAD PETER DIDN'T WAIT FOR SCRAPPER TO RETURN
1743-142912-0022 JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING THE FAR CORNER OF THE OLD ORCHARD SOME ONE CALLED HIM PETER OH PETER RABBIT CALLED THE VOICE PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKED THIS WAY LOOKED THAT WAY AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY

1743-142912-0024 IT WAS CRESTY THE GREAT CRESTED FLYCATCHER HE WAS A WEE BIT BIGGER THAN SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD YET NOT QUITE SO BIG AS WELCOME ROBIN AND MORE SLENDER
1743-142912-0025 HIS THROAT AND BREAST WERE GRAY SHADING INTO BRIGHT YELLOW UNDERNEATH HIS BACK AND HEAD WERE OF A GRAYISH BROWN WITH A TINT OF OLIVE GREEN A POINTED CAP WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM QUITE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING
