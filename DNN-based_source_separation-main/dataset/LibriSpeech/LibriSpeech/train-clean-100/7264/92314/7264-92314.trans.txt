7264-92314-0000 I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
7264-92314-0001 THIS CONNECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CERTAIN CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY THE TERM OFFICIAL UNDER CERTAIN FORMS OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE MINISTERS ONCE MADE USE OF PICKED
7264-92314-0002 AND RARE NEWSPAPERS TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THESE NEWSPAPERS CAME TO BE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IT WAS A CRUDE METHOD AND HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED EVEN BY THE SIMPLER DESPOTIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT NOTHING OF THAT KIND EXISTS NOW OF COURSE IN THE DEEPER CORRUPTION OF MODERN EUROPE
7264-92314-0003 LEAST OF ALL IN ENGLAND WHAT HAS GROWN UP HERE IS A PRESS ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT AND FAVOUR TO THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONAL POLITICS WHICH COLOURS THE WHOLE OF OUR GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS TO DAY IN ENGLAND THIS GIVES THEM SO DISTINCT A CHARACTER OF PARLIAMENTARY FALSEHOOD
7264-92314-0004 AND THAT FALSEHOOD IS SO CLEARLY DICTATED BY THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXECUTIVE POWER THAT THEY MERIT THE TITLE OFFICIAL THE REGIME UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING IS THAT OF A PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC TRADITION OF ENGLAND
7264-92314-0005 THIS PLUTOCRACY A FEW WEALTHY INTERESTS IN PART CONTROLS IN PART IS EXPRESSED BY IS IN PART IDENTICAL WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND IT HAS IN THE EXISTING CAPITALIST PRESS AN ALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92314-0006 WHICH CONTINENTAL NATIONS KNEW IN THE PAST BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT DIFFERENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CONTINENTAL EXPERIMENTS NEVER CONSISTED IN MORE THAN A FEW CHOSEN ORGANS
7264-92314-0007 THE CHARACTER OF WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN AND THE ATTITUDE OF WHICH CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE REST BUT OUR OFFICIAL PRESS FOR IT IS NO LESS COVERS THE WHOLE FIELD IT HAS IN THE REGION OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPERS NO COMPETITOR INDEED IT HAS NO COMPETITORS AT ALL
7264-92314-0008 IF ANY ONE DOUBTS THAT THIS ADJECTIVE OFFICIAL CAN PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO OUR CAPITALIST PRESS TO DAY LET HIM ASK HIMSELF FIRST WHAT THE FORCES ARE WHICH GOVERN THE NATION AND NEXT WHETHER THOSE FORCES THAT GOVERNMENT OR REGIME
7264-92314-0009 COULD BE BETTER SERVED EVEN UNDER A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT CENSORSHIP THAN IT IS IN THE GREAT DAILIES OF LONDON AND THE PRINCIPAL PROVINCIAL CAPITALS IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH THE REGIME DESIRES TO BE SUPPRESSED SUPPRESSED IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH IT DESIRES SUGGESTED SUGGESTED
7264-92314-0010 AND IS THERE ANY PUBLIC QUESTION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE REGIME AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS EVER ALLOWED TO APPEAR IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST JOURNALS THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A CASE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS
7264-92314-0011 NEVER DEALS WITH MATTERS VITAL TO ITS PRESTIGE ON THE CONTRARY IT DELIBERATELY SIDE TRACKS ANY VITAL DISCUSSION THAT SINCERE CONVICTION MAY HAVE FORCED UPON THE PUBLIC AND SPOILS THE SCENT WITH FALSE ISSUES
7264-92314-0012 ONE PAPER NOT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WAS CLAMOURING AGAINST THE EXCESS OF LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT ITS REMEDY WAS AN OPPOSITION TO BE HEADED BY A LAWYER ANOTHER WAS VERY SERIOUS UPON SECRET TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
7264-92314-0013 IT SUPPRESSED FOR MONTHS ALL REFERENCE TO THE ASTOUNDING INSTANCE OF THAT MISDEMEANOUR BY THE CONNECTIONS OF A VERY PROMINENT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN EARLY IN THE WAR AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE SINGLE REFERENCE MADE TO THIS CRIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7264-92314-0014 ANOTHER CLAMOURS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ENEMY FINANCIAL POWER IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS COUNTRY AND YET SAYS NOT A WORD UPON THE AUDITING OF THE SECRET PARTY FUNDS
7264-92314-0015 I SAY THAT THE BIG DAILY PAPERS HAVE NOW NOT ONLY THOSE OTHER QUALITIES DANGEROUS TO THE STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED BUT THAT THEY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY OFFICIAL THAT IS INSINCERE AND CORRUPT IN THEIR INTERESTED SUPPORT OF THAT PLUTOCRATIC COMPLEX WHICH IN THE DECAY OF ARISTOCRACY GOVERNS ENGLAND
7264-92314-0016 THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WHERE POWER IS CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REALLY CRITICIZE THEY SERVE A CLIQUE WHOM THEY SHOULD EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE AND BETRAY THE GENERALITY THAT IS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SALARIED PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE PERPETUALLY WATCHED WITH SUSPICION AND SHARPLY KEPT IN CONTROL
7264-92314-0017 THE RESULT IS THAT THE MASS OF ENGLISHMEN HAVE CEASED TO OBTAIN OR EVEN TO EXPECT INFORMATION UPON THE WAY THEY ARE GOVERNED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL A CERTAIN UNEASINESS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR OLD POWER OF OBSERVATION OVER PUBLIC SERVANTS HAS SLIPPED FROM THEM
7264-92314-0018 THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
7264-92314-0019 THEY HAVE NOT ADVANCED NEARLY AS FAR AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNERS AND THEIR SYSTEM THEY ARE STILL FOR THE MOST PART DUPED
7264-92314-0020 IS A VERY GREAT EVIL IT WARPS AND DEPLETES PUBLIC INFORMATION IT PREVENTS THE JUST CRITICISM OF PUBLIC SERVANTS ABOVE ALL IT GIVES IMMENSE AND IRRESPONSIBLE POWER TO A HANDFUL OF WEALTHY MEN
7264-92314-0021 AND ESPECIALLY TO THE ONE MOST WEALTHY AND UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM WHOSE WEALTH IS AN ACCIDENT OF SPECULATION WHOSE ORIGINS ARE REPULSIVE AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE AS A RULE THE WEAKNESS AND BASENESS DEVELOPED BY THIS SORT OF ADVENTURES
7264-92314-0022 THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92314-0023 EVEN WHEN GAMBLING ADVENTURERS OF THIS SORT ARE KNOWN AND RESPONSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL POLITICS THEIR POWER IS A GRAVE DANGER POSSESSING AS THE NEWSPAPER OWNERS DO EVERY POWER OF CONCEALMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
7264-92314-0024 NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
7264-92314-0025 NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
7264-92314-0026 SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHAT I HAVE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IN OUR TOP HEAVY PLUTOCRACY THERE HAS ARISEN A CERTAIN FORCE FOR WHICH I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A NAME BUT WHICH I WILL CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME THE FREE PRESS I MIGHT CALL IT THE INDEPENDENT PRESS
7264-92314-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT SUCH A WORD WOULD CONNOTE AS YET A LITTLE TOO MUCH POWER THOUGH I DO BELIEVE ITS POWER TO BE RISING AND THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE CHANGE OUR AFFAIRS
7264-92314-0028 I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUT I READ THIS FREE PRESS FRENCH AND ENGLISH COLONIAL AND AMERICAN REGULARLY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
7264-92314-0029 IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND AND FOR ALL I KNOW ELSEWHERE THERE HAS ARISEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPLETE CORRUPTION AND FALSEHOOD OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CROP OF NEW ORGANS WHICH ARE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD ORGANS OF OPINION
7264-92314-0030 THE NEW AGE WAS I THINK THE PIONEER IN THE MATTER
7264-92314-0031 SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
