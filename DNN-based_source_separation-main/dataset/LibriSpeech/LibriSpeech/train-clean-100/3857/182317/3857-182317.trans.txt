3857-182317-0000 SOME HAD OVER TRUSTFUL CHARACTERS LIKE THE SEALS OR EXPLOITABLE CHARACTERS LIKE COWS AND CHICKENS AND SHEEP SUCH CREATURES SENTENCE THEMSELVES TO BE CAPTIVES BY THEIR LACK OF AMBITION DOGS THEY HAVE MORE SPIRIT
3857-182317-0001 BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE OF KINGSHIP THROUGH WORSHIPPING US THE DOG'S FINER QUALITIES CAN'T BE PRAISED TOO WARMLY THERE IS A PURITY ABOUT HIS DEVOTION WHICH MAKES MERE MEN FEEL SPEECHLESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE FOR DOGS
3857-182317-0002 ONE MUST GRANT THEY ARE VASSALS NOT RULERS THEY ARE TOO PARASITIC THE ONE WILLING SERVANT CLASS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE BETRAYED THEM BY MAKING UNDER SIMIANS OF THEM
3857-182317-0003 LOVING US THEY LET US STOP THEIR DEVELOPING IN TUNE WITH THEIR NATURES AND THEY'VE PATIENTLY TRIED EVER SINCE TO ADOPT WAYS OF OURS THEY HAVE DONE IT TOO BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GET FAR IT'S NOT THEIR OWN ROAD
3857-182317-0004 DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
3857-182317-0005 AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
3857-182317-0006 AND WELL SHOULD THE ELEPHANT KNOW IT HE HAD THE BEST CHANCE OF ALL WISER EVEN THAN THE LION OR THE WISEST OF APES HIS WISDOM FURTHERMORE WAS BENIGN WHERE THEIRS WAS SINISTER CONSIDER HIS DIGNITY HIS POISE AND SKILL
3857-182317-0007 HE WAS PLASTIC TOO HE HAD LEARNED TO EAT MANY FOODS AND ENDURE MANY CLIMATES ONCE SOME SAY THIS RACE EXPLORED THE GLOBE THEIR BONES ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN
3857-182317-0008 SO THE ELEPHANTS COLUMBUS MAY HAVE FOUND SOME ROAD HERE BEFORE OURS THEY ARE COSMOPOLITANS THESE SUAVE AND WELL BRED BEINGS THEY HAVE RICH EMOTIONAL NATURES LONG MEMORIES LOYALTY THEY ARE STEADY AND SURE
3857-182317-0009 AND NOT NARROW NOT SELF ABSORBED FOR THEY SEEM INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PUT THEM OUT OF THE RACE COULD IT HAVE BEEN A QUITE NATURAL BELIEF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY HADN'T
3857-182317-0010 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0011 JUST AS ANTS ARE TOO ENERGETIC AND CATS TOO SHREWD FOR THEIR OWN HIGHEST GOOD SO THE ELEPHANTS SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH PATIENCE THEIR EXHIBITIONS OF IT MAY SEEM SUPERB SUCH POWER AND SUCH RESTRAINT COMBINED ARE NOBLE
3857-182317-0012 MORE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN ALLOWING OTHER SPECIES TO STAY HERE OUR WAY IS TO KILL GOOD AND BAD MALE AND FEMALE AND BABIES TILL THE FEW LAST SURVIVORS LIE HIDDEN AWAY FROM OUR GUNS
3857-182317-0013 ALL SPECIES MUST SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY THOSE ARE OUR TERMS AND COME AND LIVE IN BARNS ALONGSIDE US OR ON US AS PARASITES THE CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN WE CALL WILD IF WILD
3857-182317-0014 THEN NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS WE TREAT THEM AS OUTLAWS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE SPECIALLY WELL BROUGHT UP SHOOT THEM FOR FUN SOME MIGHT BE OUR FRIENDS WE DON'T WISH IT WE KEEP THEM ALL TERRORIZED
3857-182317-0015 WHEN ONE OF US CONQUERING MONKEY MEN ENTERS THE WOODS MOST ANIMALS THAT SCENT HIM SLINK AWAY OR RACE OFF IN A PANIC IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS DELIBERATELY BUT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LIKE RACE BY RACE THEY HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED
3857-182317-0016 SOON ALL WILL BE GONE WE GIVE NEITHER FREEDOM NOR LIFE ROOM TO THOSE WE DEFEAT IF WE HAD BEEN AS STRONG AS THE ELEPHANTS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER WHEN GREAT POWER COMES NATURALLY TO PEOPLE
3857-182317-0017 IT IS USED MORE URBANELY WE USE IT AS PARVENUS DO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THE ELEPHANT BEING BORN TO IT IS EASY GOING CONFIDENT TOLERANT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE HUMANE KING
3857-182317-0018 THE ELEPHANT IS STUPID WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING HOW TO USE TOOLS SO ARE ALL OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR OWN ISN'T IT STRANGE A TOOL IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE SENSE IS ANY OBJECT LYING AROUND
3857-182317-0019 THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE MANY CREATURES USE OBJECTS AS MATERIALS AS BIRDS USE TWIGS FOR NESTS BUT THE STEP THAT NO ANIMAL TAKES IS LEARNING FREELY TO USE THINGS AS INSTRUMENTS
3857-182317-0020 WHEN AN ELEPHANT PLUCKS OFF A BRANCH AND SWISHES HIS FLANKS AND THUS KEEPS AWAY INSECTS HE IS USING A TOOL BUT HE DOES IT ONLY BY A VAGUE AND HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IF HE ONCE BECAME A CONSCIOUS USER OF TOOLS
3857-182317-0021 HE WOULD OF COURSE GO MUCH FURTHER WE OURSELVES WHO ARE SO GOOD AT IT NOW WERE SLOW ENOUGH IN BEGINNING THINK OF THE LONG EPOCHS THAT PASSED BEFORE IT ENTERED OUR HEADS
3857-182317-0022 AND ALL THAT WHILE THE CONTEST FOR LEADERSHIP BLINDLY WENT ON WITHOUT ANY SPECIES MAKING USE OF THIS OBVIOUS AID THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED WAS SIMPLE THE REWARD WAS THE RULE OF A PLANET YET ONLY ONE SPECIES OUR OWN
3857-182317-0023 HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
3857-182317-0024 INSTEAD OF STICKING TO INSTINCT NOW STICKING TO INSTINCT HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES BUT SO HAS USING REASON WHICHEVER FACULTY YOU USE THE OTHER ATROPHIES AND PARTLY DESERTS YOU WE ARE TRYING TO USE BOTH
3857-182317-0025 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3857-182317-0026 TORN BETWEEN THOSE TWO VOICES WAILING LOUDLY AT NIGHT BY A RIVER IN HIS PUZZLED DISTRESS MY POOR FAR OFF BROTHER
3857-182317-0027 AND THEREAFTER ACHIEVE A HIGH CIVILIZATION BUT THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM THE REAL PROBLEM
3857-182317-0028 SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
3857-182317-0029 WE ARE EXPERTS ADAPTABILITY IS WHAT WE DEPEND ON WE TALK OF OUR MASTERY OF NATURE WHICH SOUNDS VERY GRAND BUT THE FACT IS WE RESPECTFULLY ADAPT OURSELVES FIRST TO HER WAYS
3857-182317-0030 WE ATTAIN NO POWER OVER NATURE TILL WE LEARN NATURAL LAWS AND OUR LORDSHIP DEPENDS ON THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH WE LEARN AND CONFORM ADROITNESS HOWEVER IS MERELY AN ABILITY TO WIN
3857-182317-0031 BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
3857-182317-0032 BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
3857-182317-0033 IN ADDITION TO THESE A RACE TO BE GREAT NEEDS SOME HUNGER SOME ITCH TO SPUR IT UP THE HARD PATH WE LATELY HAVE LEARNED TO CALL EVOLUTION THE LOVE OF TOIL IN THE ANTS AND OF CRAFT IN CATS ARE EXAMPLES
