3879-174923-0000 THAT HE SHOULD BE ELECTED AND NOW HE DID THINK IT PROBABLE THAT HE SHOULD GET THE SEAT ON A PETITION A SCRUTINY USED TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE BUSINESS BUT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW MADE AS THE SCRUTINY WOULD BE IN THE BOROUGH ITSELF
3879-174923-0001 IT WOULD COST BUT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH SHOULD HE KNOCK OFF EIGHT VOTES AND LOSE NONE HIMSELF HE WOULD BE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0002 HE KNEW THAT MANY VOTES HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR BROWBOROUGH WHICH IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN OF THEM WOULD BE KNOCKED OFF AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ANY ONE OF THOSE BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
3879-174923-0003 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE JUDGE BY WHOM ALL THIS WOULD BE DECIDED MIGHT NOT REACH TANKERVILLE IN HIS TRAVELS TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS PERHAPS NOT TILL AFTER EASTER AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT SHOULD HE DO WITH HIMSELF
3879-174923-0004 AS FOR GOING BACK TO DUBLIN THAT WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION HE HAD ENTERED UPON A FEVERISH STATE OF EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN IRELAND
3879-174923-0005 HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
3879-174923-0006 HE WOULD NOT EVEN ENDEAVOUR TO THINK HOW HE MIGHT IN SUCH CASE BEST BESTOW HIMSELF FOR THE PRESENT HE WOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE REGION OF POLITICS AND LIVE AS NEAR AS HE COULD TO THE WHIRL OF THE WHEEL OF WHICH THE SOUND WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
3879-174923-0007 SO YOU'RE AT THE OLD GAME MISTER FINN SAID HIS LANDLORD YES AT THE OLD GAME I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU NOW MISTER BUNCE HAD BEEN A VERY VIOLENT POLITICIAN
3879-174923-0008 PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
3879-174923-0009 PERHAPS THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE I THOUGHT MISTER SLIDE AND THE PEOPLE'S BANNER HAD GONE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE BUNCE MISTER SLIDE IS PRETTY WIDE AWAKE WHATEVER SIDE HE'S ON
3879-174923-0010 NOT BUT WHAT HE'S DISGRACED HIMSELF BY WHAT HE'S BEEN AND DONE NOW MISTER SLIDE IN FORMER DAYS HAD BEEN THE EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER
3879-174923-0011 BUT WHAT A MAN KEEPS IN THE WAY OF RELIGION FOR HIS OWN USE IS NEVER NOTHING TO ME AS WHAT I KEEPS IS NOTHING TO HIM I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T KEEP MUCH MISTER BUNCE AND THAT'S NOTHING TO YOU NEITHER IS IT SIR NO INDEED
3879-174923-0012 BUT WHEN WE READ OF CHURCHES AS IS CALLED STATE CHURCHES CHURCHES AS HAVE BISHOPS YOU AND I HAVE TO PAY FOR AS NEVER GOES INTO THEM BUT WE DON'T PAY THE BISHOPS MISTER BUNCE OH YES WE DO BECAUSE IF THEY WASN'T PAID
3879-174923-0013 THE MONEY WOULD COME TO US TO DO AS WE PLEASED WITH IT WE PROVED ALL THAT WHEN WE PARED THEM DOWN A BIT WHAT'S AN ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR A BOX TO PUT THE MONEY INTO TILL YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN
3879-174923-0014 JUST AS THE THEATRES ARE MISTER FINN OR THE GIN SHOPS THEN I KNOW THERE'S A DEAL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE HONEST MEN CAN COME BY THEIR OWN YOU'RE RIGHT ENOUGH MISTER FINN YOU ARE AS FAR AS CHURCHES GO AND YOU WAS RIGHT TOO WHEN YOU CUT AND RUN OFF THE TREASURY BENCH
3879-174923-0015 I NEVER EXPECTED THIS BUT I'LL DO FOR YOU MISTER FINN JUST AS I EVER DID IN THE OLD DAYS AND IT WAS I THAT WAS SORRY WHEN I HEARD OF THE POOR YOUNG LADY'S DEATH SO I WAS MISTER FINN WELL THEN I WON'T MENTION HER NAME NEVER AGAIN
3879-174923-0016 BUT AFTER ALL THERE'S BEEN BETWIXT YOU AND US IT WOULDN'T BE NATURAL TO PASS IT BY WITHOUT ONE WORD WOULD IT MISTER FINN WELL YES HE'S JUST THE SAME MAN AS EVER
3879-174923-0017 JUST AS HE USED TO DO AND NEVER GOT SO MUCH OUT OF IT
3879-174923-0018 THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEAR IT WELL YES THAT IS TRUE MISTER FINN THERE NEVER WAS A MAN BETTER AT BRINGING HOME HIS MONEY TO HIS WIFE THAN BUNCE
3879-174923-0019 IF HE'D DRINK IT WHICH HE NEVER DOES I THINK I'D BEAR IT BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO THAT NASTY UNION AND YOUNG JACK WRITES AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PRETTY NIGH MISTER FINN WHICH IS A COMFORT MISTER BUNCE WAS A JOURNEYMAN SCRIVENER AT A LAW STATIONER'S
3879-174923-0020 AND KEEPS HIS SELF BUT HE DON'T BRING HOME HIS MONEY NOR YET IT CAN'T BE EXPECTED MISTER FINN I KNOW WHAT THE YOUNG UNS WILL DO AND WHAT THEY WON'T AND MARY JANE IS QUITE HANDY ABOUT THE HOUSE NOW ONLY SHE DO BREAK THINGS
3879-174923-0021 WHICH HE USED TO KNOW SO WELL A HUNDRED MEMORIES OF FORMER DAYS CROWDED BACK UPON HIM LORD CHILTERN FOR A FEW MONTHS HAD LIVED WITH HIM AND THEN THERE HAD ARISEN A QUARREL WHICH HE HAD FOR A TIME THOUGHT WOULD DISSOLVE HIS OLD LIFE INTO RUIN
3879-174923-0022 NOW LORD CHILTERN WAS AGAIN HIS VERY INTIMATE FRIEND AND THERE HAD USED TO SIT A NEEDY MONEY LENDER WHOM
3879-174923-0023 ALAS ALAS HOW SOON MIGHT HE NOW REQUIRE THAT MONEY LENDER'S SERVICES AND THEN HE RECOLLECTED HOW HE HAD LEFT THESE ROOMS TO GO INTO OTHERS GRANDER AND MORE APPROPRIATE TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD FILLED HIGH OFFICE UNDER THE STATE
3879-174923-0024 WOULD THERE EVER AGAIN COME TO HIM SUCH CAUSE FOR MIGRATION AND WOULD HE AGAIN BE ABLE TO LOAD THE FRAME OF THE LOOKING GLASS OVER THE FIRE WITH COUNTLESS CARDS FROM COUNTESSES AND MINISTERS WIVES HE HAD OPENED THE OYSTER FOR HIMSELF ONCE
3879-174923-0025 WHEN THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WOULD HE BE ABLE TO INSERT THE POINT AGAIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DIFFICULT SHELLS WOULD THE COUNTESSES ONCE MORE BE KIND TO HIM WOULD DRAWING ROOMS BE OPENED TO HIM AND SOMETIMES OPENED TO HIM AND TO NO OTHER
3879-174923-0026 THEN HE THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS IN WHICH WONDERFUL THINGS HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM SINCE THAT HE HAD BEEN A MARRIED MAN AND THOSE SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS AND THOSE WONDERFUL WORDS HAD IN NO DEGREE ACTUATED HIM IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE
3879-174923-0027 HE HAD LEFT ALL THOSE THINGS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL AS THOUGH TELLING HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS A BETTER LIFE THAN THEY OFFERED TO HIM BUT WAS HE SURE THAT HE HAD FOUND IT TO BE BETTER HE HAD CERTAINLY SIGHED FOR THE GAUDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT
3879-174923-0028 WHILE HIS YOUNG WIFE WAS LIVING HE HAD KEPT HIS SIGHS DOWN SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HEAR THEM BUT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS NEW LIFE HAD BEEN VAPID AND FLAVOURLESS NOW HE HAD BEEN TEMPTED BACK AGAIN TO THE OLD HAUNTS
3879-174923-0029 WOULD THE COUNTESSES CARDS BE SHOWERED UPON HIM AGAIN ONE CARD OR RATHER NOTE HAD REACHED HIM WHILE HE WAS YET AT TANKERVILLE REMINDING HIM OF OLD DAYS IT WAS FROM MISSUS LOW THE WIFE OF THE BARRISTER
3879-174923-0030 WITH WHOM HE HAD WORKED WHEN HE HAD BEEN A LAW STUDENT IN LONDON SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH THEM AFTER THE OLD FASHION IN BAKER STREET NAMING A DAY AS TO WHICH SHE PRESUMED THAT HE WOULD BY THAT TIME HAVE FINISHED HIS AFFAIRS AT TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0031 INTIMATING ALSO THAT MISTER LOW WOULD THEN HAVE FINISHED HIS AT NORTH BROUGHTON NOW MISTER LOW HAD SAT FOR NORTH BROUGHTON BEFORE PHINEAS LEFT LONDON AND HIS WIFE SPOKE OF THE SEAT AS A CERTAINTY
3879-174923-0032 PHINEAS COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM FEELING THAT MISSUS LOW INTENDED TO TRIUMPH OVER HIM BUT NEVERTHELESS HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION THEY WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM EXPLAINING THAT
3879-174923-0033 AS NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN TOWN NOBODY HAD BEEN ASKED TO MEET HIM IN FORMER DAYS HE HAD BEEN VERY INTIMATE IN THAT HOUSE HAVING RECEIVED FROM BOTH OF THEM MUCH KINDNESS MINGLED PERHAPS WITH SOME TOUCH OF SEVERITY ON THE PART OF THE LADY
3879-174923-0034 BUT THE GROUND FOR THAT WAS GONE AND MISSUS LOW WAS NO LONGER PAINFULLY SEVERE A FEW WORDS WERE SAID AS TO HIS GREAT LOSS MISSUS LOW ONCE RAISED HER EYEBROWS IN PRETENDED SURPRISE
3879-174923-0035 WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
3879-174923-0036 AND IF HER HUSBAND COULD NOT BE SAID TO LIVE BY MEANS OF THE SAME ATMOSPHERE IT WAS BECAUSE THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS HAD BEEN DRAWN CHIEFLY IN THE VICE CHANCELLOR'S COURT IN LINCOLN'S INN BUT HE NO DOUBT
3879-174923-0037 WOULD BE VERY MUCH DISTURBED INDEED SHOULD HE EVER BE TOLD THAT HE WAS REQUIRED AS AN EXPECTANT MEMBER OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PARTY TO VOTE FOR THE DISESTABLISHMENT
3879-174923-0038 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
3879-174923-0039 I AM AFRAID THAT MISSUS LOW WHEN SHE ALLOWED HERSELF TO SPEAK THUS ENERGETICALLY ENTERTAINED SOME CONFUSED IDEA THAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION WERE ONE AND THE SAME THING OR AT LEAST THAT THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD TOGETHER
3879-174923-0040 YOU HAVEN'T THROWN THE FIRST STONE SAID MISTER LOW BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN UP THE THROWING AT THE FIRST MOMENT IN WHICH STONES MAY BE DANGEROUS NO STONES CAN BE DANGEROUS SAID MISSUS LOW
3879-174923-0041 THE IDEA OF A STATE CHURCH SAID PHINEAS IS OPPOSED TO MY THEORY OF POLITICAL PROGRESS WHAT I HOPE IS THAT MY FRIENDS WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I ATTACK THE PROTESTANT CHURCH BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC IF I WERE A PRIEST
3879-174923-0042 IT WOULD BE MY BUSINESS TO DO SO BUT I AM NOT A PRIEST MISTER LOW GAVE HIS OLD FRIEND A BOTTLE OF HIS BEST WINE AND IN ALL FRIENDLY OBSERVANCES TREATED HIM WITH DUE AFFECTION BUT NEITHER DID HE NOR DID HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0043 FOR A MOMENT ABSTAIN FROM ATTACKING THEIR GUEST IN RESPECT TO HIS SPEECHES AT TANKERVILLE IT SEEMED INDEED TO PHINEAS THAT AS MISSUS LOW WAS BUCKLED UP IN SUCH TRIPLE ARMOUR THAT SHE FEARED NOTHING
3879-174923-0044 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS LOUD IN EXPRESSING HER ABHORRENCE OF THE ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH IF SHE FEARED NOTHING WHY SHOULD SHE SCREAM SO LOUDLY BETWEEN THE TWO HE WAS A GOOD DEAL CRUSHED AND CONFOUNDED
3879-174923-0045 AND MISSUS LOW WAS VERY TRIUMPHANT WHEN SHE ALLOWED HIM TO ESCAPE FROM HER HANDS AT TEN O'CLOCK BUT AT THAT MOMENT NOTHING HAD AS YET BEEN HEARD IN BAKER STREET OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PROPOSITION TO THE ELECTORS OF EAST BARSETSHIRE
3879-174923-0046 POOR MISSUS LOW WE CAN FORESEE THAT THERE IS MUCH GRIEF IN STORE FOR HER AND SOME ROCKS AHEAD TOO IN THE POLITICAL CAREER OF HER HUSBAND PHINEAS WAS STILL IN LONDON HANGING ABOUT THE CLUBS DOING NOTHING
3879-174923-0047 DISCUSSING MISTER DAUBENY'S WONDERFUL TREACHERY WITH SUCH MEN AS CAME UP TO TOWN AND WAITING FOR THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM LADY LAURA KENNEDY DRESDEN NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH
3879-174923-0048 I HAVE HEARD WITH GREAT PLEASURE FROM MY SISTER IN LAW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN STAYING WITH THEM AT HARRINGTON HALL IT SEEMS SO LIKE OLD DAYS THAT YOU AND OSWALD AND VIOLET SHOULD BE TOGETHER SO MUCH MORE NATURAL
3879-174923-0049 THAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE LIVING IN DUBLIN I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF YOU AS LIVING ANY OTHER LIFE THAN THAT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DOWNING STREET AND THE CLUBS NOR DO I WISH TO DO SO
3879-174923-0050 AND WHEN I HEAR OF YOU AT HARRINGTON HALL I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO THE OTHER THINGS DO TELL ME WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH OSWALD AND VIOLET OF COURSE HE NEVER WRITES HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ON MARRYING
3879-174923-0051 ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE AT LAST GOT A PERSON TO DO A DUTY WHICH HAS ALWAYS HITHERTO BEEN NEGLECTED VIOLET DOES WRITE
3879-174923-0052 AS THE WIFE OF A MASTER OF HOUNDS
3879-174923-0053 AS THE ART IS REAL SHE TOLD ME HOW POOR DEAR LADY BALDOCK COMMUNICATED TO YOU HER UNHAPPINESS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER IN A MANNER THAT MADE EVEN ME LAUGH AND WOULD MAKE THOUSANDS LAUGH IN DAYS TO COME WERE IT EVER TO BE PUBLISHED
3879-174923-0054 BUT OF HER INSIDE LIFE OF HER BABY OR OF HER HUSBAND AS A HUSBAND SHE NEVER SAYS A WORD YOU WILL HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND HAVE ENOUGH OF THE FEMININE SIDE OF A MAN'S CHARACTER TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME HOW THEY ARE LIVING
3879-174923-0055 I AM SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TOGETHER BECAUSE VIOLET HAS MORE COMMON SENSE THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER KNEW AND PRAY TELL ME ABOUT THE AFFAIR AT TANKERVILLE MY COUSIN BARRINGTON WRITES ME WORD THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET THE SEAT
3879-174923-0056 HE DECLARES THAT MISTER BROWBOROUGH IS ALMOST DISPOSED NOT TO FIGHT THE BATTLE THOUGH A MAN MORE DISPOSED TO FIGHT NEVER BRIBED AN ELECTOR BUT BARRINGTON SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOU MANAGED AS WELL AS YOU DID BY GETTING OUTSIDE THE TRACES AS HE CALLS IT
3879-174923-0057 WE CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT STRONG AGAINST THE CHURCH
3879-174923-0058 BUT IF IT MUST COME WHY NOT BY YOUR HANDS AS WELL AS BY ANY OTHER IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU IN YOUR HEART SHOULD LOVE A PROTESTANT ASCENDANT CHURCH BUT AS BARRINGTON SAYS A HORSE WON'T GET OATS
3879-174923-0059 AT HOME AS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS BUT HE WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY NOW IT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ALMOST TOO GREAT A TROUBLE TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD
3879-174923-0060 OR TO REMAIN HERE BY MYSELF BUT HE WILL CONSENT TO NEITHER IN TRUTH THE BURDEN OF IDLENESS HAS NOW FALLEN UPON HIM SO HEAVILY THAT HE CANNOT SHAKE IT OFF HE DREADS THAT HE MAY BE CALLED UPON TO DO ANYTHING
3879-174923-0061 TO ME IT IS ALL ONE TRAGEDY I CANNOT BUT THINK OF THINGS AS THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS SINCE MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE BOTH IN THE CABINET AND YOU YOUNG AS YOU WERE STOOD BUT ONE STEP BELOW IT OSWALD WAS OUT IN THE COLD HE WAS VERY POOR
3879-174923-0062 PAPA THOUGHT ALL EVIL OF HIM VIOLET HAD REFUSED HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE QUARRELLED WITH YOU AND ALL THE WORLD SEEMED AGAINST HIM THEN OF A SUDDEN YOU VANISHED AND WE VANISHED AN INEFFABLE MISERY FELL UPON ME AND UPON MY WRETCHED HUSBAND
3879-174923-0063 ALL OUR GOOD THINGS WENT FROM US AT A BLOW I AND MY POOR FATHER BECAME AS IT WERE OUTCASTS BUT OSWALD SUDDENLY RETRICKED HIS BEAMS AND IS FLAMING IN THE FOREHEAD OF THE MORNING SKY HE I BELIEVE
3879-174923-0064 HE WON HIS WIFE HONESTLY DID HE NOT AND HE HAS EVER BEEN HONEST IT IS MY PRIDE TO THINK I NEVER GAVE HIM UP BUT THE BITTER PART OF MY CUP CONSISTS IN THIS THAT AS HE HAS WON WHAT HE HAS DESERVED SO HAVE WE
3879-174923-0065 I COMPLAIN OF NO INJUSTICE OUR CASTLE WAS BUILT UPON THE SAND WHY SHOULD MISTER KENNEDY HAVE BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0066 THERE IS NO ONE WHOM I CAN ASK TO TELL ME OF HIM THAT HE DID NOT ATTEND DURING THE LAST SESSION I DO KNOW AND WE PRESUME THAT HE HAS NOW ABANDONED HIS SEAT I FEAR THAT HIS HEALTH IS BAD
3879-174923-0067 BY THE GLOOM OF HIS LIFE I SUPPOSE THAT HE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY AT LOUGHLINTER FROM TIME TO TIME I AM IMPLORED BY HIM TO RETURN TO MY DUTY BENEATH HIS ROOF HE GROUNDS HIS DEMAND ON NO AFFECTION OF HIS OWN
3879-174923-0068 ON NO PRESUMPTION THAT ANY AFFECTION CAN REMAIN WITH ME HE SAYS NO WORD OF HAPPINESS HE OFFERS NO COMFORT HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE WITH PROMISES OF FUTURE CARE HE MAKES HIS CLAIM SIMPLY ON HOLY WRIT AND ON THE FEELING OF DUTY WHICH
3879-174923-0069 THENCE OUGHT TO WEIGH UPON ME HE HAS NEVER EVEN TOLD ME THAT HE LOVES ME BUT HE IS PERSISTENT IN DECLARING THAT THOSE WHOM GOD HAS JOINED TOGETHER NOTHING HUMAN SHOULD SEPARATE
3879-174923-0070 I HAVE TOLD PAPA THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU AND HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
3879-174923-0071 TO BE ABLE TO TALK AGAIN TO ONE WHO KNOWS ALL THE ERRORS AND ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY PAST LIFE AS YOU DO DRESDEN IS VERY COLD IN THE WINTER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD MIND THAT WE ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ROOMS BUT MY FATHER BEARS THE TEMPERATURE WONDERFULLY WELL
3879-174923-0072 THOUGH HE COMPLAINS IN MARCH WE MOVE DOWN SOUTH FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS DO COME IF YOU CAN MOST SINCERELY YOURS LAURA KENNEDY
