5192-19397-0013 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS MASTER TO SLIP BACKWARDS UPON THE GRASS A LITTLE BEYOND HIS BODY IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT THE GREATER SWEEP AND BY AN UNFORCED COMPRESSION AT THE SAME TIME OF HIS CAP WITH THE THUMB AND THE TWO FOREFINGERS OF HIS LEFT BY WHICH THE DIAMETER
5192-19397-0014 OF THE CAP BECAME REDUCED SO THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID RATHER TO BE INSENSIBLY SQUEEZ'D THAN PULL'D OFF WITH A FLATUS THE CORPORAL ACQUITTED HIMSELF OF BOTH IN A BETTER MANNER THAN THE POSTURE OF HIS AFFAIRS PROMISED AND HAVING HEMMED TWICE
