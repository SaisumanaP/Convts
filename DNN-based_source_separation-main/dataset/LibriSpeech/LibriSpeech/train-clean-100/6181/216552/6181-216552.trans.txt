6181-216552-0000 POTHIER SEEMS TO THINK THAT PROPERTY LIKE ROYALTY EXISTS BY DIVINE RIGHT HE TRACES BACK ITS ORIGIN TO GOD HIMSELF
6181-216552-0001 PRINCIPIUM HE BEGINS IN THIS WAY GOD IS THE ABSOLUTE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE AND ALL THAT IT CONTAINS DOMINI
6181-216552-0002 FOR THE HUMAN RACE HE HAS CREATED THE EARTH AND ALL ITS CREATURES AND HAS GIVEN IT A CONTROL OVER THEM SUBORDINATE ONLY TO HIS OWN THOU MADEST HIM TO HAVE DOMINION OVER THE WORKS OF THY HANDS
6181-216552-0003 THOU HAST PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET SAYS THE PSALMIST GOD ACCOMPANIED THIS GIFT WITH THESE WORDS ADDRESSED TO OUR FIRST PARENTS AFTER THE CREATION BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY
6181-216552-0004 ARE FATHERS UNNATURAL AND CHILDREN PRODIGAL GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE WHY THEN HAVE I RECEIVED NONE HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET
6181-216552-0005 AND I HAVE NOT WHERE TO LAY MY HEAD MULTIPLY HE TELLS US THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER POTHIER AH LEARNED POTHIER THAT IS AS EASY TO DO AS TO SAY
6181-216552-0006 BUT YOU MUST GIVE MOSS TO THE BIRD FOR ITS NEST THE HUMAN RACE HAVING MULTIPLIED MEN DIVIDED AMONG THEMSELVES THE EARTH AND MOST OF THE THINGS UPON IT THAT WHICH FELL TO EACH
6181-216552-0007 FROM THAT TIME EXCLUSIVELY BELONGED TO HIM THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY SAY RATHER THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION MEN LIVED IN A STATE OF COMMUNISM
6181-216552-0008 WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT MATTERS LITTLE THEN THERE WAS NO PROPERTY NOT EVEN PRIVATE POSSESSION THE GENESIS AND GROWTH OF POSSESSION GRADUALLY FORCING PEOPLE TO LABOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT
6181-216552-0009 THEY AGREED EITHER FORMALLY OR TACITLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHICH THAT THE LABORER SHOULD BE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR THAT IS THEY SIMPLY DECLARED THE FACT
6181-216552-0010 THAT THEREAFTER NONE COULD LIVE WITHOUT WORKING IT NECESSARILY FOLLOWED THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF PRODUCTS THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF LABOR AND THAT TO OBTAIN EQUALITY OF LABOR
6181-216552-0011 THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF FACILITIES FOR LABOR WHOEVER WITHOUT LABOR GOT POSSESSION BY FORCE OR BY STRATEGY OF ANOTHER'S MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE DESTROYED EQUALITY
6181-216552-0012 WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
6181-216552-0013 BUT IN WHAT THING EVIDENTLY IN THE PRODUCT NOT IN THE SOIL SO THE ARABS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT AND SO ACCORDING TO CAESAR AND TACITUS THE GERMANS FORMERLY HELD THE ARABS
6181-216552-0014 WHO ADMIT A MAN'S PROPERTY IN THE FLOCKS WHICH HE HAS RAISED DO NOT REFUSE THE CROP TO HIM WHO PLANTED THE SEED BUT THEY DO NOT SEE WHY ANOTHER HIS EQUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO PLANT IN HIS TURN
6181-216552-0015 THE INEQUALITY WHICH RESULTS FROM THE PRETENDED RIGHT OF THE FIRST OCCUPANT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE BASED ON NO PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND WHEN ALL THE LAND FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INHABITANTS
6181-216552-0016 THERE RESULTS A MONOPOLY IN THEIR FAVOR AGAINST THE REST OF THE NATION TO WHICH THEY DO NOT WISH TO SUBMIT WELL THEY HAVE SHARED THE LAND
6181-216552-0017 AND THAT THIS METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION FIXED AND DURABLE IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO PRODUCTION BUT HOW COULD THIS DIVISION GIVE TO EACH A TRANSFERABLE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A THING TO WHICH
6181-216552-0018 ALL HAD AN INALIENABLE RIGHT OF POSSESSION
6181-216552-0019 THIS METAMORPHOSIS FROM POSSESSOR TO PROPRIETOR IS LEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE IT IMPLIES IN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS THE UNION OF POSSESSOIRE AND PETITOIRE
6181-216552-0020 AND THE MUTUAL CONCESSIONS OF THOSE WHO SHARE THE LAND ARE NOTHING LESS THAN TRAFFIC IN NATURAL RIGHTS THE ORIGINAL CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND WHO WERE ALSO THE ORIGINAL MAKERS OF THE LAW WERE NOT AS LEARNED
6181-216552-0021 INTO THE RIGHT OF ABSOLUTE PROPERTY BUT WHY HAVE NOT THOSE WHO IN LATER TIMES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JUS IN RE AND JUS AD REM
6181-216552-0022 APPLIED IT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPERTY ITSELF LET ME CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE WRITERS ON JURISPRUDENCE TO THEIR OWN MAXIMS THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY PROVIDED IT CAN HAVE A CAUSE CAN HAVE BUT ONE
6181-216552-0023 DOMINIUM NON POTEST NISI EX UNA CAUSA
6181-216552-0024 I CAN POSSESS BY SEVERAL TITLES I CAN BECOME PROPRIETOR BY ONLY ONE
6181-216552-0025 TO ME AS MY SHARE BUT NONE OF THESE TITLES CONFER UPON ME THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY FOR IF I ATTEMPT TO BASE IT UPON OCCUPANCY SOCIETY CAN REPLY
6181-216552-0026 I AM THE ORIGINAL OCCUPANT IF I APPEAL TO MY LABOR IT WILL SAY IT IS ONLY ON THAT CONDITION THAT YOU POSSESS IF I SPEAK OF AGREEMENTS IT WILL RESPOND
6181-216552-0027 THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH ONLY YOUR RIGHT OF USE SUCH HOWEVER ARE THE ONLY TITLES WHICH PROPRIETORS ADVANCE THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ANY OTHERS INDEED EVERY RIGHT
6181-216552-0028 IT IS POTHIER WHO SAYS IT SUPPOSES A PRODUCING CAUSE IN THE PERSON WHO ENJOYS IT
6181-216552-0029 IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
6181-216552-0030 HAS SOCIETY RECOGNIZED A RIGHT INJURIOUS TO ITSELF WHERE THERE IS NO PRODUCING CAUSE WHY IN ACCORDING POSSESSION HAS IT ALSO CONCEDED PROPERTY WHY HAS THE LAW SANCTIONED THIS ABUSE OF POWER
6181-216552-0031 SOME PHILOSOPHERS PRETEND THAT MAN IN EMPLOYING HIS FORCES UPON A NATURAL OBJECT SAY A FIELD OR A TREE ACQUIRES A RIGHT ONLY TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE MAKES
6181-216552-0032 TO THE FORM WHICH HE GIVES TO THE OBJECT NOT TO THE OBJECT ITSELF USELESS DISTINCTION IF THE FORM COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR QUESTION
6181-216552-0033 BUT AS THIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE THE APPLICATION OF MAN'S STRENGTH TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VISIBLE WORLD IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY THE PRIMARY ORIGIN OF RICHES
6181-216552-0034 VAIN PRETEXT IF THE FORM CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT NOR PROPERTY FROM POSSESSION POSSESSION MUST BE SHARED IN ANY CASE
6181-216552-0035 SOCIETY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO FIX THE CONDITIONS OF PROPERTY LET US SUPPOSE THAT AN APPROPRIATED FARM YIELDS A GROSS INCOME OF TEN THOUSAND FRANCS AND AS VERY SELDOM HAPPENS
6181-216552-0036 THE POSSESSOR OF THIS FARM SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GUARD HIS REPUTATION AS A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY BY PAYING TO SOCIETY TEN THOUSAND FRANCS LESS THE TOTAL COSTS OF CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0037 AND THE THREE THOUSAND FRANCS REQUIRED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS FAMILY THIS PAYMENT IS NOT RENT IT IS AN INDEMNITY WHAT SORT OF JUSTICE IS IT THEN WHICH MAKES SUCH LAWS AS THIS
6181-216552-0038 WHEREAS SINCE LABOR SO CHANGES THE FORM OF A THING THAT THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT DESTROYING THE THING ITSELF EITHER SOCIETY MUST BE DISINHERITED
6181-216552-0039 OR THE LABORER MUST LOSE THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND WHEREAS IN EVERY OTHER CASE PROPERTY IN RAW MATERIAL WOULD GIVE A TITLE TO ADDED IMPROVEMENTS MINUS THEIR COST
6181-216552-0040 AND WHEREAS IN THIS INSTANCE PROPERTY IN IMPROVEMENTS OUGHT TO GIVE A TITLE TO THE PRINCIPAL
6181-216552-0041 SHALL NEVER BE ADMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS BUT ONLY AGAINST SOCIETY IN SUCH A WAY DO LEGISLATORS ALWAYS REASON IN REGARD TO PROPERTY
6181-216552-0042 THE LAW IS INTENDED TO PROTECT MEN'S MUTUAL RIGHTS THAT IS THE RIGHTS OF EACH AGAINST EACH AND EACH AGAINST ALL
6181-216552-0043 THE LAW MAKERS ALWAYS DISREGARD THE LATTER AS LONG AS MAN IS OPPOSED TO MAN PROPERTY OFFSETS PROPERTY AND THE TWO FORCES BALANCE EACH OTHER AS SOON AS MAN IS ISOLATED
6181-216552-0044 THAT IS OPPOSED TO THE SOCIETY WHICH HE HIMSELF REPRESENTS JURISPRUDENCE IS AT FAULT THEMIS HAS LOST ONE SCALE OF HER BALANCE LISTEN TO THE PROFESSOR OF RENNES THE LEARNED TOULLIER
6181-216552-0045 POSSESSION AGRICULTURE WAS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE AND AGRICULTURE IN ITS TURN FAVORS POPULATION AND NECESSITATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT PROPERTY
6181-216552-0046 FOR WHO WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PLOUGH AND SOW IF HE WERE NOT CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REAP TO SATISFY THE HUSBANDMAN IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO GUARANTEE HIM POSSESSION OF HIS CROP ADMIT EVEN THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
6181-216552-0047 PROTECTED IN HIS RIGHT OF OCCUPATION OF LAND AS LONG AS HE REMAINED ITS CULTIVATOR THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WAS ALL THAT THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION DEMANDED
6181-216552-0048 BUT PROPERTY PROPERTY THE RIGHT OF ESCHEAT OVER LANDS WHICH ONE NEITHER OCCUPIES NOR CULTIVATES
6181-216552-0049 WHO PRETENDED TO HAVE IT AGRICULTURE ALONE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT PROPERTY POSITIVE LAWS WERE NEEDED AND MAGISTRATES TO EXECUTE THEM IN A WORD
6181-216552-0050 THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
6181-216552-0051 AND ALSO LAWS FOR ITS PROTECTION SO WE ARE INDEBTED TO PROPERTY FOR THE CREATION OF THE CIVIL STATE
6181-216552-0052 A STATE WHICH AT FIRST WAS DESPOTISM THEN MONARCHY THEN ARISTOCRACY TODAY DEMOCRACY AND ALWAYS TYRANNY WITHOUT THE TIES OF PROPERTY IT NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
6181-216552-0053 TO SUBORDINATE MEN TO THE WHOLESOME YOKE OF THE LAW AND WITHOUT PERMANENT PROPERTY THE EARTH WOULD HAVE REMAINED A VAST FOREST LET US ADMIT THEN
6181-216552-0054 IT IS THE CIVIL LAW WHICH HOLDS THAT WHEN ONCE ACQUIRED PROPERTY CAN BE LOST ONLY BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR AND THAT IT EXISTS EVEN AFTER THE PROPRIETOR HAS RELINQUISHED POSSESSION OF THE THING
6181-216552-0055 AND IT HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF A THIRD PARTY THUS PROPERTY AND POSSESSION WHICH ORIGINALLY WERE CONFOUNDED BECAME THROUGH THE CIVIL LAW TWO DISTINCT AND INDEPENDENT THINGS TWO THINGS WHICH IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW
6181-216552-0056 HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER IN COMMON IN THIS WE SEE WHAT A WONDERFUL CHANGE HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN PROPERTY AND TO WHAT AN EXTENT NATURE HAS BEEN ALTERED BY THE CIVIL LAWS THUS THE LAW IN ESTABLISHING PROPERTY
6181-216552-0057 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATURAL LAW THE APPLICATION OF A MORAL PRINCIPLE IT HAS LITERALLY CREATED A RIGHT OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN PROVINCE IT HAS REALIZED AN ABSTRACTION A METAPHOR
6181-216552-0058 IT HAS INDORSED MONSTROUS PRETENSIONS IT HAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOR IMPIOUS VOWS AS IF IT WERE ABLE TO FILL UP A BOTTOMLESS PIT
6181-216552-0059 BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
6181-216552-0060 RESTORED RE ENFORCED AS THE PALLADIUM OF SOCIETY HAS TROUBLED THE CONSCIENCES OF THE PEOPLE HAS OBSCURED THE MINDS OF THE MASTERS AND HAS INDUCED ALL THE CATASTROPHES
6181-216552-0061 THIS IT IS WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS CONDEMNED BUT WHICH ITS IGNORANT MINISTERS DEIFY WHO HAVE AS LITTLE DESIRE TO STUDY NATURE AND MAN AS ABILITY TO READ THEIR SCRIPTURES
6181-216552-0062 BUT INDEED WHAT GUIDE DID THE LAW FOLLOW IN CREATING THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY WHAT PRINCIPLE DIRECTED IT WHAT WAS ITS STANDARD WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IT WAS EQUALITY
6181-216552-0063 UNLESS THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION WERE AT THE SAME TIME SECURED TO HIM TO FORTIFY THE WEAK AGAINST THE INVASION OF THE STRONG TO SUPPRESS SPOLIATION AND FRAUD
6181-216552-0064 AND THE CUPIDITY OF THE HUSBANDMAN INCREASE IT WAS THOUGHT BEST TO PUT A BRIDLE ON AMBITION BY SETTING BOUNDARIES WHICH AMBITION WOULD IN VAIN ATTEMPT TO OVERSTEP
6181-216552-0065 A MULTITUDE OF RIGHTS SOME FOUNDED IN NATURE BUT WRONGLY INTERPRETED AND STILL MORE WRONGLY APPLIED INHERITANCE GIFT AND EXCHANGE OTHERS LIKE THE PRIVILEGES OF BIRTH AND POSITION
6181-216552-0066 FOR THE BARBARIANS INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN ANNUAL QUARRELS AND FIGHTS INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MOVING THEIR HOUSES FURNITURE AND FAMILIES FROM SPOT TO SPOT THAN TO ASSIGN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL A FIXED AND INALIENABLE ESTATE
6181-216552-0067 IT WAS NOT RIGHT THAT THE SOLDIER ON RETURNING FROM AN EXPEDITION SHOULD FIND HIMSELF DISPOSSESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICES WHICH HE HAD JUST RENDERED TO HIS COUNTRY
6181-216552-0068 AND BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE EQUALITY IN THE DIVISION SHOULD BE KEPT UP FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER WITHOUT A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND UPON THE DEATH OF EACH FAMILY
6181-216552-0069 THE FEUDAL AND PATRIARCHAL CUSTOM OF RECOGNIZING ONLY ONE HEIR THEN BY A QUITE CONTRARY APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY THE ADMISSION OF ALL THE CHILDREN TO A SHARE IN THEIR FATHER'S ESTATE
6181-216552-0070 WHO NEVER HAD THE FAINTEST IDEA OF STATISTICS VALUATION OR POLITICAL ECONOMY FURNISH US WITH PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION THE LAW SAYS A MODERN WRITER ON JURISPRUDENCE
6181-216552-0071 BY WHICH SOCIAL WANTS MUST BE SATISFIED THE PEOPLE DO NOT VOTE IT THE LEGISLATOR DOES NOT EXPRESS IT THE SAVANT DISCOVERS AND FORMULATES IT BUT IN FACT THE LAW
6181-216552-0072 WAS IN THE BEGINNING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF A WANT AND THE INDICATION OF THE MEANS OF SUPPLYING IT AND UP TO THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN NOTHING ELSE THE LEGISTS WITH MECHANICAL FIDELITY
6181-216552-0073 FULL OF OBSTINACY ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY BURIED IN LITERALITIES
6181-216552-0074 TO BE SURE WERE WELL MEANING BUT WANTING IN FORESIGHT THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE OLD FOUNDERS OF THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY THAT THE PERPETUAL AND ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO RETAIN ONE'S ESTATE A RIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO THEM
6181-216552-0075 EQUITABLE BECAUSE IT WAS COMMON INVOLVES THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SELL GIVE GAIN AND LOSE IT THAT IT TENDS CONSEQUENTLY TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT EQUALITY
6181-216552-0076 THEY DISREGARDED IT THE PRESENT WANT OCCUPIED THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION AND AS ORDINARILY HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES THE DISADVANTAGES WERE AT FIRST SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND THEY PASSED UNNOTICED
6181-216552-0077 THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE INGENUOUS LEGISLATORS THAT IF PROPERTY IS RETAINABLE BY INTENT ALONE NUDO ANIMO
6181-216552-0078 IT CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LET TO LEASE TO LOAN AT INTEREST TO PROFIT BY EXCHANGE TO SETTLE ANNUITIES AND TO LEVY A TAX ON A FIELD WHICH INTENT RESERVES
6181-216552-0079 WHILE THE BODY IS BUSY ELSEWHERE THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE FATHERS OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE THAT IF THE RIGHT OF INHERITANCE IS ANY THING OTHER THAN NATURE'S METHOD OF PRESERVING EQUALITY OF WEALTH
6181-216552-0080 FAMILIES WILL SOON BECOME VICTIMS OF THE MOST DISASTROUS EXCLUSIONS AND SOCIETY
6181-216552-0081 WILL COME TO ITS DEATH THROUGH OPULENCE
6181-216552-0082 THAT IS THAT INHERITANCE AND SUCCESSION WILL LAST FOR EVER WHOEVER MAY BE THE RECOGNIZED HEIR BUT THE SAINT SIMONIANS WISH THE HEIR TO BE DESIGNATED BY THE MAGISTRATE
6181-216552-0083 OTHERS WISH HIM TO BE CHOSEN BY THE DECEASED OR ASSUMED BY THE LAW TO BE SO CHOSEN
6181-216552-0084 TO DAY THE REAL CONTROLLER OF INHERITANCE IS CHANCE OR CAPRICE NOW IN MATTERS OF LEGISLATION CHANCE AND CAPRICE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GUIDES
6181-216552-0085 IT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING THE MANIFOLD DISTURBANCES WHICH FOLLOW IN THE WAKE OF CHANCE THAT NATURE AFTER HAVING CREATED US EQUAL SUGGESTS TO US THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6181-216552-0086 WHICH SERVES AS A VOICE BY WHICH SOCIETY ASKS US TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG ALL OUR BROTHERS HIM WHOM WE JUDGE BEST FITTED TO COMPLETE OUR UNFINISHED WORK THEY DID NOT FORESEE
6181-216552-0087 BUT WHY NEED I GO FARTHER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PLAIN ENOUGH AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO CRITICISE THE WHOLE CODE THE HISTORY OF PROPERTY AMONG THE ANCIENT NATIONS IS THEN
6181-216552-0088 SIMPLY A MATTER OF RESEARCH AND CURIOSITY IT IS A RULE OF JURISPRUDENCE THAT THE FACT DOES NOT SUBSTANTIATE THE RIGHT NOW PROPERTY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
6181-216552-0089 THEN THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY DOES NOT LEGITIMATE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY MAN IS MISTAKEN AS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY THE NATURE OF RIGHT
6181-216552-0090 OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE IS IT TO US THAT THE INDIAN RACE WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR CLASSES THAT ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE AND THE GANGES BLOOD AND POSITION FORMERLY DETERMINED
6181-216552-0091 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS PLACED PROPERTY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS THAT THEY ACCOMPANIED WITH RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES THE WORK OF PARTITIONING THE LAND AND APPRAISING THEIR GOODS
6181-216552-0092 THE VARIETY OF THE FORMS OF PRIVILEGE DOES NOT SANCTION INJUSTICE THE FAITH OF JUPITER
6181-216552-0093 THAN DO THE MYSTERIES OF VENUS THE WANTON AGAINST CONJUGAL CHASTITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS OF NO EFFECT AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY BECAUSE THIS RIGHT
6181-216552-0094 RESTING OF NECESSITY UPON EQUALITY CONTRADICTS ITS PRINCIPLE THE DECISION OF THE RELIGIONS WHICH HAVE SANCTIONED IT IS OF NO EFFECT BECAUSE IN ALL AGES THE PRIEST HAS SUBMITTED TO THE PRINCE
6181-216552-0095 THE SOCIAL ADVANTAGES ATTRIBUTED TO PROPERTY CANNOT BE CITED IN ITS BEHALF BECAUSE THEY ALL SPRING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF POSSESSION WHAT MEANS THEN THIS DITHYRAMB UPON PROPERTY
6181-216552-0096 THE SHELTER OF HIS FAMILY IN A WORD THE CORNER STONE OF THE DOMESTIC DWELLING OF COMMUNITIES AND OF THE POLITICAL STATE POSSESSION ALONE PRODUCED ALL THAT
6181-216552-0097 ETERNAL PRINCIPLE PROPERTY IS ETERNAL LIKE EVERY NEGATION OF ALL SOCIAL AND CIVIL INSTITUTIONS FOR THAT REASON
6181-216552-0098 EVERY INSTITUTION AND EVERY LAW BASED ON PROPERTY WILL PERISH IT IS A BOON AS PRECIOUS AS LIBERTY FOR THE RICH PROPRIETOR IN FACT THE CAUSE OF THE CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0099 OF THE HABITABLE EARTH IF THE CULTIVATOR CEASED TO BE A TENANT WOULD THE LAND BE WORSE CARED FOR THE GUARANTEE AND THE MORALITY OF LABOR UNDER THE REGIME OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0100 LABOR IS NOT A CONDITION BUT A PRIVILEGE THE APPLICATION OF JUSTICE WHAT IS JUSTICE WITHOUT EQUALITY OF FORTUNES A BALANCE WITH FALSE WEIGHTS
6181-216552-0101 ALL MORALITY A FAMISHED STOMACH KNOWS NO MORALITY ALL PUBLIC ORDER CERTAINLY THE PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0102 STUMBLING BLOCK OF ALL WHICH OUGHT TO BE SUCH IS PROPERTY TO SUM UP AND CONCLUDE NOT ONLY DOES OCCUPATION LEAD TO EQUALITY IT PREVENTS PROPERTY
6181-216552-0103 FOR SINCE EVERY MAN FROM THE FACT OF HIS EXISTENCE HAS THE RIGHT OF OCCUPATION AND IN ORDER TO LIVE MUST HAVE MATERIAL FOR CULTIVATION ON WHICH HE MAY LABOR AND SINCE
6181-216552-0104 ON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS VARIES CONTINUALLY WITH THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE QUANTITY
6181-216552-0105 OF MATERIAL WHICH EACH LABORER MAY CLAIM VARIES WITH THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS CONSEQUENTLY THAT OCCUPATION IS ALWAYS SUBORDINATE TO POPULATION FINALLY THAT INASMUCH AS POSSESSION
6181-216552-0106 IN RIGHT CAN NEVER REMAIN FIXED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT THAT IT CAN EVER BECOME PROPERTY EVERY OCCUPANT IS THEN NECESSARILY A POSSESSOR
6181-216552-0107 HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THING ENTRUSTED TO HIM HE MUST USE IT IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERAL UTILITY WITH A VIEW TO ITS PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT HE HAS NO POWER TO TRANSFORM IT
6181-216552-0108 TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
6181-216552-0109 AN IMMORALITY BORN OF VIOLENCE THE MOST MONSTROUS PRETENSION THAT THE CIVIL LAWS EVER SANCTIONED MAN RECEIVES HIS USUFRUCT FROM THE HANDS OF SOCIETY
6181-216552-0110 WHICH ALONE IS THE PERMANENT POSSESSOR THE INDIVIDUAL PASSES AWAY SOCIETY IS DEATHLESS WHAT A PROFOUND DISGUST FILLS MY SOUL WHILE DISCUSSING SUCH SIMPLE TRUTHS
6181-216552-0111 THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED NOT BY THE WILL BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER PROPERTY CANNOT EXIST
6181-216552-0112 THIS NO CODE HAS EVER EXPRESSED THIS NO CONSTITUTION CAN ADMIT THESE ARE AXIOMS WHICH THE CIVIL LAW AND THE LAW OF NATIONS DENY
6181-216552-0113 BUT I HEAR THE EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PARTISANS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM LABOR LABOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF PROPERTY READER DO NOT BE DECEIVED
