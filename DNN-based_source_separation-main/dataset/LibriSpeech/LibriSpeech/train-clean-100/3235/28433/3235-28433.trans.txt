3235-28433-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN GOING TO NOME ONE BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN HUNDRED I SAILED AGAIN FOR ALASKA THIS TIME FOR NOME FROM SAN FRANCISCO
3235-28433-0001 AN ENGLISH FAMILY CONSISTING OF THE MOTHER ONE SON AND A DAUGHTER WERE TO ACCOMPANY ME AND WE HAD SPENT WEEKS IN MAKING OUR PREPARATIONS WE WERE TAKING SUPPLIES OF CLOTHING FOOD
3235-28433-0002 TENTS AND BEDDING SUFFICIENT TO LAST UNTIL SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS PLANS OF WORK AFTER OUR ARRIVAL BROUGHT IN RETURNS MY HOPE WAS TO MEET MY FATHER THERE FOR HE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO TO THE NEW GOLD FIELDS
3235-28433-0003 WHERE HE COULD DO BEACH MINING I WAS NOT ABOVE DOING ANY HONEST WORK AND FELT CONFIDENT THAT I COULD MAKE MY WAY IF I COULD GAIN AN ENTRANCE INTO THAT COUNTRY THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE ALL WORKERS AND I HAD KNOWN THEM FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE
3235-28433-0004 OUR STEAMER WAS THE GOOD SHIP SAINT PAUL BELONGING TO THE ALASKA COMMERCIAL COMPANY AND WAS ADVERTISED TO SAIL ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH
3235-28433-0005 WHEN I LAUGHINGLY CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE SHIP TO THE FACT THAT THAT DATE FELL UPON FRIDAY AND MANY PERSONS OBJECTED TO SAILING UPON THAT DAY HE POSTPONED THE STARTING OF THE SAINT PAUL TO MAY TWENTY SIXTH
3235-28433-0006 AND WE LEFT THE DOCK ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AMID THE CHEERS AND HAND WAVING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE BIG BOAT OFF FOR NOME THE STEAMER WAS WELL FITTED OUT SPICK AND SPAN IN FRESH CARPETS AND PAINT
3235-28433-0007 AND CROWDED TO THE UTMOST CAPACITY FOR COMFORT EVERY STATEROOM WAS FULL EACH SEAT AT THE TABLES OCCUPIED NOT A FOOT OF SPACE ABOVE OR BELOW DECKS WAS LEFT UNUSED BUT PROVISION WAS MADE FOR ALL
3235-28433-0008 AND THE SHIP WAS WELL MANNED I WAS NOW MUCH GRATIFIED TO LEARN THAT THERE WERE MANY ON BOARD WHOM I HAD MET BEFORE THAT THE STEWARD STEWARDESS AND SEVERAL OF THE WAITERS HAD BEEN ON DUTY ON THE STEAMER BERTHA
3235-28433-0009 DURING MY TRIP OUT FROM ALASKA THE FALL BEFORE WHILE I WAS UPON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE PASSENGERS WITH WHOM I HAD TRAVELED FROM THE SAME PLACE OF PASSENGERS WE HAD ALL TOLD
3235-28433-0010 FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN OF THESE THIRTY FIVE WERE WOMEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHILD ON BOARD AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE BLACK EYED GIRL WITH HER ESKIMO MOTHER AND WHITE FATHER FROM GOLOVIN BAY
3235-28433-0011 WHOM I HAD SEEN AT SAINT MICHAEL SOME MONTHS BEFORE AND WHO WAS NOW GOING BACK TO HER NORTHERN HOME SHE WORE A SAILOR SUIT OF NAVY BLUE SERGE TRIMMED WITH WHITE BRAID AND WAS AS COY AND CUNNING AS EVER
3235-28433-0012 NOT SPEAKING OFTEN TO STRANGERS BUT LAUGHING AND RUNNING AWAY TO HER MOTHER WHEN ADDRESSED FROM THE DAY WE SAILED FROM SAN FRANCISCO UNTIL WE REACHED NOME I MISSED NO MEALS IN THE DINING SALON
3235-28433-0013 A PACE WHICH MY ENGLISH FRIENDS AND OTHERS COULD NOT FOLLOW FOR THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLY ILL IN THE REGION OF THEIR DIGESTIVE APPARATUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS I SLEPT FOR HOURS EACH DAY AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE TRIP
3235-28433-0014 DURING THE NINE DAYS SAIL FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO UNALASKA A DISTANCE OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILES I STUDIED WELL THE PASSENGERS WE HAD PREACHERS ON BOARD
3235-28433-0015 AS WELL AS DOCTORS LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND MINERS AND THERE WERE WOMEN GOING TO NOME TO START EATING HOUSES HOTELS AND MERCANTILE SHOPS THERE WERE SEVERAL SWEDISH MISSIONARIES
3235-28433-0016 ONE A ZEALOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO GOING TO THE SWEDISH MISSION AT GOLOVIN BAY THIS YOUNG PERSON WAS PRETTY AND PLEASANT AND I WAS GLAD TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE AS WELL AS THAT OF THREE OTHER WOMEN SPEAKING THE SAME TONGUE
3235-28433-0017 AND OCCUPYING THE NEXT STATEROOM TO MINE THE LAST NAMED WERE GOING TO START A RESTAURANT IN NOME AS THEY WERE SOCIABLE JOLLY AND GOOD SAILORS FOR THE MOST PART I ENJOYED THEIR SOCIETY THEY HAD ALL LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR YEARS
3235-28433-0018 AND THOUGH NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER WERE FIRM FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING AND WERE UNITING THEIR LITTLE FORTUNES IN THE HOPE OF MAKING GREATER ONES THE YOUNG MISSIONARY WAS A FRIEND TO THE OTHER THREE
3235-28433-0019 AND I FOUND NO BETTER OR MORE CONGENIAL COMPANIONS ON BOARD THE SHIP THAN THESE FOUR HONEST HARD WORKING WOMEN SO FULL OF HOPE COURAGE AND GOOD SENSE AS WELL AS CHRISTIANITY
3235-28433-0020 LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE PLACED BY A SEEMING CHANCE IN AN ADJOINING STATEROOM WERE TO BE MY FELLOW WORKERS AND TRUE FRIENDS NOT ONLY FOR THE COMING MONTHS IN THAT ARCTIC LAND TO WHICH WE WERE GOING BUT
3235-28433-0021 AS THE SEQUEL WILL SHOW PERHAPS FOR YEARS TO COME NOT MANY DAYS HAD PASSED WHEN WE FOUND THAT WE HAD ON BOARD WHAT FEW STEAMERS CAN BOAST OF AND THAT WAS AN ORCHESTRA OF PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS AMONG THE WAITERS
3235-28433-0022 THESE WERE MEN GOING WITH ALL THE OTHERS TO SEEK THEIR FORTUNES IN THE NEW GOLD FIELDS WORKING THEIR PASSAGE AS WAITERS ON THE SHIP TO NOME WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LEAVE IT THREE EVENINGS IN THE WEEK THESE MUSICIANS
3235-28433-0023 WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL SINGERS ON BOARD GAVE CONCERTS IN THE DINING SALON WHICH THOUGH IMPROMPTU WERE VERY ENJOYABLE A SWEET AND TRAINED SINGER WAS THE ENGLISH GIRL OF OUR COMPANY
3235-28433-0024 AND SHE SANG MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PASSENGERS WHEN SHE SANG ONE EVENING IN HER CLEAR SYMPATHETIC VOICE THE SELECTION
3235-28433-0025 OH WHERE IS MY WANDERING BOY TONIGHT THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE IN THE ROOM AND THE MIND OF MANY A MAN WENT BACK TO HIS OLD HOME AND PRAYING MOTHER IN SOME FAR DISTANT STATE
3235-28433-0026 MAKING HIM RESOLVE TO WRITE OFTENER TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT BE COMFORTED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WHEREABOUTS AND WELFARE THESE EVENINGS WERE SOMETIMES VARIED BY RECITATIONS FROM AN ELOCUTIONIST ON BOARD
3235-28433-0027 AND A PRACTISED CLOG DANCER EXCITED THE RISIBLES OF THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY USUALLY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER AT HIS EXHIBITION OF FLYING HEELS DAY AFTER DAY PASSED
3235-28433-0028 THOSE WHO WERE CONTINUALLY SEASICK HAD DIVERSION ENOUGH IT WAS USELESS FOR US TO TELL THEM A PATHETIC TALE OF SOME ONE WHO AT SOME TIME HAD BEEN MORE ILL THAN THEY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BELIEVE A WORD OF IT
3235-28433-0029 AND IT WAS EQUALLY USELESS TO RECOMMEND AN ANTIDOTE FOR MAL DE MER SUCH AS THEIRS NO ONE WAS EVER SO ILL BEFORE THEY SAID THEY KNEW THEY SHOULD DIE AND BE BURIED AT SEA
3235-28433-0030 AND HOPED THEY WOULD IF THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THEIR SUFFERINGS WE TRIED AT LAST TO GIVE THEM COMFORT BY RECOMMENDING OUT OF FORMER EXPERIENCES SHIP'S BISCUIT DRY TOAST AND POP CORN AS REMEDIES
3235-28433-0031 BUT ONLY RECEIVED BLACK LOOKS AS OUR REWARD WE THEN CONCLUDED THAT A DIET OF TEA COFFEE AND SOUP WAS EXACTLY SUCH A ONE AS THE FISHES WOULD RECOMMEND COULD THEY SPEAK
3235-28433-0032 THESE FAVORITE AND MUCH USED LIQUIDS KEEPING UP A CONTINUAL SWISHING IN ONE'S INTERIOR REGIONS AND CAUSING ONE TO TRUTHFULLY SPEAK OF THE SAME AS INFERNAL INSTEAD OF INTERNAL
3235-28433-0033 BUT THEY WERE ALL TREE PHYSICAL AS WELL AS FREE MORAL AGENTS AND DECIDED THESE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES AT LAST WE ENTERED THE JAPAN CURRENT AND THE WEATHER WAS WARMER AND MORE ENJOYABLE
3235-28433-0034 ON MONDAY JUNE FOURTH WE SAW FROM THE DECK A FEW DRIFTING LOGS AND A QUANTITY OF SEAWEED AND THESE WITH THE PRESENCE OF GULLS AND GOONIES FLYING OVERHEAD CONVINCED US THAT WE WERE NEARING LAND
3235-28433-0035 WE WERE NOT MISTAKEN AFTER EATING AN EXCELLENT SIX O'CLOCK DINNER WE WENT ABOVE TO FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN HIGH ROCKY CLIFFS WHICH LOOMED UP INTO MOUNTAINS NOT FAR DISTANT
3235-28433-0036 AND WE KNEW WE WERE AGAIN AT THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AND IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF UNIMAK PASS AS WE DREW NEARER AND ENTERED THE HARBOR SO WELL LAND LOCKED THE SUN DIPPED LOW INTO YELLOW RED WESTERN WATERS
3235-28433-0037 THEREBY CASTING LONG SHADOWS ASLANT OUR PATHWAY SO DELICATELY SHADED IN GREENS THE LITTLE HAMLET OF DUTCH HARBOR NESTLED COSILY AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH BORDERED THE BAY
3235-28433-0038 AND HERE NUMBERS OF SHIPS LAY ANCHORED AT REST PASSING ALONG EASILY BEYOND ANOTHER HIGH MOUNTAIN WE WERE SOON AT THE DOCK OF UNALASKA BESIDE OTHER GREAT SHIPS IN PORT
3235-28433-0039 BOTH GROUPS OF CRAFT WERE EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR THE ICE TO CLEAR FROM BEHRING SEA BEFORE PROCEEDING ON THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND WE COUNTED SIXTEEN SHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND SIZES THE MAJORITY OF THEM LARGE STEAMERS
3235-28433-0040 ALL WERE LOADED WITH PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT FOR NOME SCOUT BOATS HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT OUT TO INVESTIGATE AND FIND IF POSSIBLE A PASSAGE THROUGH THE ICE FIELDS
3235-28433-0041 AND THE RETURN OF THESE SCOUTS WITH GOOD NEWS WAS ANXIOUSLY WATCHED AND WAITED FOR AS THE MOST DESIRED THING AT THAT TIME WAS A SPEEDY AND SAFE LANDING ON THE SUPPOSEDLY GOLDEN BEACH SANDS OF NOME
3235-28433-0042 AT UNALASKA WE SPENT FOUR DAYS TAKING ON FRESH WATER AND COAL DURING WHICH TIME PASSENGERS VISITED BACK AND FORTH FROM THE WAITING STEAMERS MANY PERSONS HAVING FRIENDS ON OTHER BOATS
3235-28433-0043 AND EACH HAVING A CURIOSITY TO SEE IF THEY WERE FARING AS WELL OR ILL AS HE COMPARING NOTES AS TO THE EXPENSE OF TRAVELING WITH THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES ET CETERA PASSENGERS ON THE SAINT PAUL AGREED THAT THEY HAD NO KICK COMIN
3235-28433-0044 WHICH WAS ONE OF THE COMMONEST SLANG PHRASES INTENDED TO MEAN THAT THEY HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THE ALASKA COMMERCIAL COMPANY AND THEIR STEAMER SAINT PAUL ALL WERE WELL CARED FOR AND SATISFIED AS WELL THEY MIGHT BE
3235-28433-0045 WITH THE SERVICE OF THE SHIP'S MEN LEAVING UNALASKA THE SUN SHONE CLEAR AND COLD UPON THE MOUNTAINS WHERE IN PLACES THE SIDES LOOKED BLACK FROM THE LATE FIRES STARTED IN THE DEEP TUNDRA BY MISCREANTS
3235-28433-0046 THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH SNOW DOWN DEEP GORGES DASHED MOUNTAIN WATERS OF MELTING SNOW AND ICE HURRYING TO LEAP OFF GULLIED AND ROCKY CLIFFS INTO THE SEA THEIR PROGRESS WAS NEVER IMPEDED
3235-28433-0047 NO TREE NOR SHRUB OBSTRUCTED THE WAY WITH GNARLED OLD TRUNKS TWISTED ROOTS OR LOW HANGING BRANCHES FOR NONE GROW IN UNALASKA
3235-28433-0048 AND THE BOLD DIGNITY AND GRANDEUR OF THE MOUNTAINS IS NEVER DIMINISHED BY THESE LESSER OBJECTS AS OUR SHIP SAILED OUT INTO BEHRING SEA WE WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE STEAMER GEORGE W ELDER WHOSE MASTER
3235-28433-0049 AN OLD FRIEND OF OUR CAPTAIN HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW IN OUR WAKE HE BEING LESS FAMILIAR THAN THE LATTER WITH ALASKAN WATERS
