7278-246956-0000 AFTER THE SERMON AS THE SERMON DREW TO A CLOSE AND THE MIST OF HIS EMOTION BEGAN TO DISPERSE INDIVIDUAL FACES OF HIS AUDIENCE AGAIN DAWNED OUT ON THE PREACHER'S KEN
7278-246956-0001 MISTER DREW'S HEAD WAS DOWN AS I HAVE ALWAYS SAID CERTAIN THINGS HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD PRACTISED IN HIS MANHOOD CERTAIN MEAN WAYS COUNTED HONEST ENOUGH IN THE TRADE HAD BECOME TO HIM
7278-246956-0002 REGARDED FROM THE IDEAL POINT OF THE DIVINE IN
7278-246956-0003 OF THE ADVANTAGES HE TOOK FOR HE KNEW THAT HE HAD KNOWN THEM SUCH AS SHRUNK FROM THE LIGHT NOT COMING
7278-246956-0004 HE WAS NOW DOING HIS BEST TO BANISH THEM FROM HIS BUSINESS AND YET THEY WERE A PAINFUL PRESENCE TO HIS SPIRIT SO GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
7278-246956-0005 FROM THEM BY THE INDWELLING PRESENCE OF THE GOD OF ALL LIVING MEN AND TRUE MERCHANTS WAS A BLESSEDNESS UNSPEAKABLE SMALL WAS THE SUSPICION IN THE ABBEY CHURCH OF OLASTON THAT MORNING
7278-246956-0006 BATTERY OF SIN SPRUNG SUFFERING WITHSTANDING AND ENDURING AND STILLING THE RECOIL OF THE AWFUL FORCE WHEREWITH HIS FATHER HAD LAUNCHED THE WORLDS AND GIVEN BIRTH TO HUMAN SOULS
7278-246956-0007 WITH WILLS THAT MIGHT BECOME FREE AS HIS OWN WHILE WINGFOLD HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN GENERAL TERMS WITH THE RACE IN HIS MIND'S AND THE CONGREGATION IN HIS BODY'S EYE HE HAD YET THOUGHT MORE OF ONE SOUL WITH ITS ONE CRIME AND ITS INTOLERABLE BURDEN
7278-246956-0008 THAN ALL THE REST LEOPOLD WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIM AND WHILE HE STROVE TO AVOID ABSORPTION IN A PERSONAL INTEREST HOWEVER JUSTIFIABLE IT WAS OF NECESSITY
7278-246956-0009 OF HIS UTTERANCE AT TIMES INDEED HE FELT AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AND TO HIM ONLY AT OTHERS ALTHOUGH THEN HE SAW HER NO MORE THAN HIM
7278-246956-0010 THAT HE WAS COMFORTING THE SISTER INDIVIDUALLY IN HOLDING OUT TO HER BROTHER THE MIGHTY HOPE OF A RESTORED PURITY AND WHEN ONCE MORE HIS MIND COULD RECEIVE THE MESSAGES
7278-246956-0011 AND THE FIRM MOUTH HAD FORGOTTEN ITSELF INTO A TREMULOUS FORM WHICH THE STILLNESS OF ABSORPTION HAD THERE FOR THE MOMENT FIXED BUT EVEN ALREADY ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT YET READ IT UPON HER
7278-246956-0012 COUNTENANCE A SNAKE HAD BEGUN TO LIFT ITS HEAD FROM THE CHAOTIC SWAMP WHICH RUNS A CREEK AT LEAST INTO EVERY SOUL THE RUDIMENTARY DESOLATION A REMNANT OF THE TIME
7278-246956-0013 WHEN THE WORLD WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID AND THE SNAKE SAID WHY THEN DID HE NOT SPEAK LIKE THAT TO MY LEOPOLD WHY DID HE NOT COMFORT HIM WITH SUCH A GOOD HOPE
7278-246956-0014 WELL BECOMING A PRIEST OF THE GENTLE JESUS OR IF HE FANCIED HE MUST SPEAK OF CONFESSION WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK OF IT IN PLAIN HONEST TERMS INSTEAD OF SUGGESTING THE IDEA OF IT SO THAT THE POOR BOY
7278-246956-0015 IMAGINED IT CAME FROM HIS OWN SPIRIT AND MUST THEREFORE BE OBEYED AS THE WILL OF GOD SO SAID THE SNAKE AND BY THE TIME HELEN HAD WALKED HOME WITH HER AUNT THE GLOW HAD SUNK FROM HER SOUL AND
7278-246956-0016 A GRAY WINTRY MIST HAD SETTLED DOWN UPON HER SPIRIT AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT IF THIS LAST HOPE IN GEORGE SHOULD FAIL HER SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE MATTER TO TROUBLE HER ANY FARTHER
7278-246956-0017 SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN AND AS LEOPOLD HAD CHOSEN OTHER COUNSELLORS HAD THUS DECLARED HER UNWORTHY OF CONFIDENCE AND AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND DONE FOR LOVE OF HIM
7278-246956-0018 HAD SHE NOT DONE ENOUGH WOULD EVEN HER FATHER REQUIRE MORE OF HER THAN SHE HAD ALREADY DONE AND ENDURED
7278-246956-0019 FROM THE COUCH SHE TOOK NO NOTICE THAT HE HAD GOT UP AND DRESSED WHILE SHE WAS AT CHURCH AND HE KNEW THAT A CLOUD HAD COME BETWEEN THEM AND THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD BORNE AND DONE FOR HIM HE AND HIS SISTER WERE NOW FARTHER APART
7278-246956-0020 FOR THE TIME AT LEAST THAN WHEN OCEANS LAY BETWIXT THEIR BIRTH AND THEIR MEETING AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING BACK WITH VAGUE LONGING EVEN TO THE TERRIBLE OLD HOUSE OF GLASTON
7278-246956-0021 AND THE SHARING OF THEIR AGONY THEREIN HIS EYES FOLLOWED HER AS SHE WALKED ACROSS TO THE DRESSING ROOM AND THE TEARS ROSE AND FILLED THEM BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND THE SISTER WHO ALL THE TIME OF THE SERMON
7278-246956-0022 HAD BEEN FILLED WITH WAVE UPON WAVE OF WISHING THAT POLDIE COULD HEAR THIS COULD HEAR THAT COULD HAVE SUCH A THOUGHT TO COMFORT HIM SUCH A LOVELY WORD TO DRIVE THE HORROR FROM HIS SOUL
7278-246956-0023 NOW CAST ON HIM A CHILLY GLANCE AND SAID NEVER A WORD OF THE THINGS TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SUCH HEAVINGS OF THE SPIRIT OCEAN FOR SHE FELT WITH AN INSTINCT MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN HER WILL
7278-246956-0024 THAT THEY WOULD BUT STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS DETERMINATION TO DO WHATEVER THE TEACHER OF THEM MIGHT APPROVE AS SHE REPASSED HIM TO GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SHE DID INDEED SAY A WORD OF KINDNESS BUT IT WAS IN A FORCED TONE
7278-246956-0025 AND WAS ONLY ABOUT HIS DINNER HIS EYES OVER FLOWED BUT HE SHUT HIS LIPS SO TIGHT THAT HIS MOUTH GREW GRIM WITH DETERMINATION AND NO MORE TEARS CAME TO THE FRIEND WHO JOINED HER AT THE CHURCH DOOR AND IN GEORGE
7278-246956-0026 IN ORDER THEREBY TO ATTAIN TO A BETTER INNOCENCE THAN WITHOUT IT COULD EVER BE THEIRS HOW FAR SHE MISTOOK OR HOW FAR SHE KNEW OR SUSPECTED THAT SHE SPOKE FALSELY I WILL NOT PRETEND TO KNOW BUT ALTHOUGH SHE SPOKE AS SHE DID
7278-246956-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING EITHER IN THE CURATE OR IN THE SERMON THAT HAD QUIETED HER A LITTLE AND SHE WAS LESS CONTEMPTUOUS IN HER CONDEMNATION OF HIM THAN USUAL HAPPILY BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS THE CURATE
7278-246956-0028 WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO CRIPPLE THE TRUTH AND BLIND THEIR OWN SOULS
7278-246956-0029 OCCASION TO THE DISHONEST TO CAVIL AND CONDEMN IMAGINE SAINT PAUL HAVING A PREVISION OF HOW HE WOULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND HEEDING IT WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BECOME OF ALL THOSE HIS MOST MAGNIFICENT OUTBURSTS AND WOULD ANY AMOUNT OF
7278-246956-0030 APOSTOLIC CAREFULNESS HAVE PROTECTED HIM I SUSPECT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MORE VULGAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS STILL TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHO LOVES NOT IS BUT TO GIVE HIM THE MORE
7278-246956-0031 PLENTIFUL MATERIAL FOR MISINTERPRETATION LET A MAN HAVE TRUTH IN THE INWARD PARTS AND OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS HEART LET HIS MOUTH SPEAK IF THEN HE SHOULD HAVE GROUND TO FEAR HONEST MISUNDERSTANDING
7278-246956-0032 LET HIM PREACH AGAIN TO ENFORCE THE TRUTH FOR WHICH HE IS JEALOUS AND IF IT SHOULD SEEM TO ANY THAT THE TWO UTTERANCES NEED RECONCILING LET THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE THEM CONSISTENT RECONCILE THEM FOR THEMSELVES
7278-246956-0033 THAT AFTER AN EARLY BREAKFAST HE HAD MOUNTED HELEN'S MARE AND SET OUT TO CALL ON MISTER HOOKER
7278-246956-0034 THE GROOM TOOK HIS HORSE IN THE STREET AND HE CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM HELEN HASTENED TO MEET HIM WELL GEORGE SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY OH IT'S ALL RIGHT WILL BE AT LEAST I AM SURE
7278-246956-0035 I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER AUNT HAS THE GOOD SENSE NEVER TO INTERRUPT US THERE HE ADDED I'LL JUST RUN AND SHOW MYSELF TO LEOPOLD HE MUST NOT SUSPECT THAT I AM OF YOUR PARTY AND
