3235-11599-0000 CHAPTER TEN MEASURE NINETY SEVEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EYE A MEASURE IS THAT PORTION OF THE STAFF FOUND BETWEEN TWO BARS IN CERTAIN CASES THIS SPACE MAY BE LESS THAN A MEASURE
3235-11599-0001 AS E G AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A MOVEMENT BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EAR A SINGLE ISOLATED MEASURE IS NOT POSSIBLE AND THE TERM MUST THEREFORE BE DEFINED IN THE PLURAL FORM
3235-11599-0002 MEASURES ARE SIMILARLY ACCENTED GROUPS OF EVENLY SPACED BEATS EACH GROUP HAVING AT LEAST ONE ACCENTED AND ONE NON ACCENTED BEAT THE STRONGEST ACCENT FALLS NORMALLY ON THE FIRST BEAT IN THE MEASURE
3235-11599-0003 TWO ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE INVOLVED IN THE ORDINARY MUSICAL MEASURE ONE A GROUP OF EVEN BEATS OR PULSES ALWAYS FELT THOUGH NOT ALWAYS ACTUALLY SOUNDED
3235-11599-0004 ONE OR MORE OF THESE BEATS BEING STRONGER THAN THE REST TWO CERTAIN RHYTHMIC FIGURES
3235-11599-0005 CETERA WHICH FORM THE ACTUAL MUSICAL CONTENT OF THESE GROUPS THE STUDENT WILL NOTE THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RHYTHM AND MEASURE RHYTHM IS THE REGULAR RECURRENCE OF ACCENT IN A SERIES OF BEATS OR PULSES
3235-11599-0006 WHILE MEASURE IS THE GROUPING OF THESE BEATS ACCORDING TO SOME SPECIFIED SYSTEM IN LISTENING TO A PIECE OF MUSIC TWO HEARERS A AND B MAY FEEL THE RHYTHM EQUALLY STRONGLY
3235-11599-0007 BUT A MAY SUBJECTIVELY GROUP THE BEATS INTO ONE TWO ONE TWO ET CETERA WHILE B FEELS THE GROUPS AS ONE TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR ET CETERA
3235-11599-0008 RHYTHM IS THUS SEEN TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL THING INHERENT IN THE MUSIC ITSELF WHILE MEASURE IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AT LEAST AN ARBITRARY GROUPING WHICH MUSICIANS HAVE ADOPTED FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES NINETY EIGHT
3235-11599-0009 IN SYNCOPATION THE NORMAL SYSTEM OF ACCENTING IS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED AND THE ACCENTED TONE FALLS ON THE REGULARLY UNACCENTED PART OF THE MEASURE SYNCOPATION MAY THEREFORE BE DEFINED AS THE TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION OF A NORMAL SERIES OF ACCENTS
3235-11599-0010 AND COMPOUND A SIMPLE MEASURE IS ONE WHICH HAS BUT A SINGLE ACCENT
3235-11599-0011 TWO BEAT MEASURE AND THREE BEAT MEASURE A COMPOUND MEASURE IS AS ITS NAME IMPLIES ONE MADE UP BY COMBINING TWO OR MORE SIMPLE MEASURES OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE IN SLOW TEMPO
3235-11599-0012 INTO SEVERAL CONSTITUENT GROUPS THE PRINCIPAL COMPOUND MEASURES ARE FOUR BEAT AND SIX BEAT BOTH BEING REFERRED TO AS COMPOUND DUPLE MEASURES FIVE BEAT SEVEN BEAT NINE BEAT AND TWELVE BEAT MEASURES
3235-11599-0013 ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS COMPOUND MEASURES AN ENGLISH WRITER
3235-11599-0014 CLASSIFIES MEASURES AS DUPLE TRIPLE OR QUADRUPLE SPECIFYING THAT A SIMPLE MEASURE IS ONE IN WHICH EACH BEAT IS REPRESENTED BY A NOTE WHOSE VALUE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO HALVES
3235-11599-0015 AND THAT A COMPOUND MEASURE IS ONE IN WHICH EACH BEAT IS REPRESENTED BY A DOTTED NOTE WHOSE VALUE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS
3235-11599-0016 THERE IS THUS SEEN TO BE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SIMPLE AND COMPOUND WHEN APPLIED IN THIS CONNECTION THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION AT ISSUE BEING WHETHER FOUR BEAT MEASURE IS AN INDIVIDUAL VARIETY
3235-11599-0017 OR WHETHER IT IS A VARIETY COMPOUNDED OUT OF TWO BEAT MEASURES EITHER BY PLACING TWO OF THESE IN A GROUP OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE INTO A LARGER NUMBER OF BEATS AS IS OFTEN NECESSARY IN SLOW TEMPI
3235-11599-0018 PERHAPS THE EASIEST WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY IS TO ADMIT THAT BOTH MAY BE TRUE
3235-11599-0019 IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE BEATS THE FIRST ONE BEING ACCENTED THE SECOND AND THIRD UNACCENTED
3235-11599-0020 THREE EIGHTH THREE QUARTER AND THREE HALF MEASURE RESPECTIVELY THREE QUADRUPLE IN WHICH THERE ARE FOUR BEATS THE FIRST AND THIRD BEING ACCENTED PRIMARY ACCENT ON ONE SECONDARY ACCENT ON THREE
3235-11599-0021 THE SECOND AND FOURTH UNACCENTED
3235-11599-0022 FOUR SEXTUPLE IN WHICH THERE ARE SIX BEATS THE FIRST AND FOURTH BEING ACCENTED THE OTHERS NOT IN RAPID TEMPI THIS IS ALWAYS TAKEN AS COMPOUND DUPLE MEASURE A DOTTED QUARTER NOTE HAVING A BEAT
3235-11599-0023 IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THE TWO MEASURES
3235-11599-0024 BUT THESE ARE PRACTICALLY ALWAYS TAKEN AS THREE BEAT AND FOUR BEAT MEASURES RESPECTIVELY BEING EQUIVALENT TO THESE IF EACH GROUP OF THREE TONES IS THOUGHT OF AS A TRIPLET
3235-11599-0025 QUINTUPLE FIVE BEAT AND SEPTUPLE SEVEN BEAT MEASURES ARE OCCASIONALLY MET WITH BUT THESE ARE RARE AND WILL ALWAYS BE SPORADIC THE FIVE BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN AS A COMBINATION OF THREE AND TWO
3235-11599-0026 OR OF TWO AND THREE SOMETIMES A MIXTURE OF BOTH IN THE SAME COMPOSITION WHILE THE SEVEN BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN IN GROUPS OF FOUR AND THREE OR OF THREE AND FOUR
3235-11599-0027 BUT USAGE VARIES SOMEWHAT AND THE SECOND SIGN IS SOMETIMES USED TO INDICATE FOUR HALF MEASURE
3235-11599-0028 BUT AN INCOMPLETE CIRCLE DIFFERENTIATING TWO BEAT IMPERFECT MEASURE FROM THREE BEAT PERFECT MEASURE
