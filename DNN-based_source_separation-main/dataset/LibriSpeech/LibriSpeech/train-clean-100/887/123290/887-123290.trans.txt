887-123290-0000 WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
887-123290-0001 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0003 JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
887-123290-0004 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0006 TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
887-123290-0007 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0009 THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND THE NORTH WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY WHAT COULD I DO COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
887-123290-0010 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0012 I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
887-123290-0013 WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
887-123290-0014 THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
887-123290-0015 I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
887-123290-0016 AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
887-123290-0017 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0018 THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0020 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
887-123290-0021 FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
887-123290-0022 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0023 WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
887-123290-0024 HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
887-123290-0025 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123290-0027 HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
887-123290-0028 LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
887-123290-0029 FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
887-123290-0030 BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
887-123290-0031 HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
