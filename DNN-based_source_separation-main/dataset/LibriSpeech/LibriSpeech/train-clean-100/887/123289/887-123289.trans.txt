887-123289-0000 WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RAFT WAS DASHED UPON THE ROCKS IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL I FELT MYSELF HURLED INTO THE WAVES AND IF I ESCAPED FROM DEATH AND IF MY BODY WAS NOT TORN OVER THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ROCKS
887-123289-0001 IT WAS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL ARM OF HANS CAME TO MY RESCUE THE BRAVE ICELANDER CARRIED ME OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WAVES OVER A BURNING SAND WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BY THE SIDE OF MY UNCLE
887-123289-0002 THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
887-123289-0003 I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
887-123289-0004 THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
887-123289-0005 THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL
887-123289-0006 AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY ALAS IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG
887-123289-0007 UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
887-123289-0008 ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
887-123289-0009 I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
887-123289-0010 BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
887-123289-0011 I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
887-123289-0012 I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
887-123289-0013 YES TO BE SURE WE HAVE HANS IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAVED A LARGE PART OF OUR CARGO BUT STILL LET US GO AND MAKE SURE
887-123289-0014 WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
887-123289-0015 ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
887-123289-0016 AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
887-123289-0017 AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
887-123289-0018 AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE WITHOUT IT
887-123289-0019 SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
887-123289-0020 THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
887-123289-0021 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0022 FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
887-123289-0023 I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
887-123289-0024 THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
887-123289-0025 I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
887-123289-0026 I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
887-123289-0027 AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
887-123289-0028 YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION
887-123289-0029 THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
887-123289-0030 LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
887-123289-0031 SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT
887-123289-0032 THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
887-123289-0033 PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
887-123289-0034 WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
887-123289-0035 HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY
887-123289-0036 AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
887-123289-0037 AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
887-123289-0038 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123289-0039 IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
