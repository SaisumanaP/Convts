1502-122619-0000 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0001 COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
1502-122619-0002 THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
1502-122619-0003 IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
1502-122619-0004 THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
1502-122619-0005 THAT THEIR HATCHETS WERE DULL AND TIME WAS NECESSARY TO SHARPEN THEM THE POLITIC CAPTAIN OF THE CANADAS HAD DEEMED IT WISER TO SUBMIT TO ENTERTAIN A PASSIVE FRIEND THAN BY ANY ACTS OF ILL JUDGED SEVERITY TO CONVERT HIM INTO AN OPEN ENEMY
1502-122619-0006 ON THAT MORNING WHEN MAGUA LED HIS SILENT PARTY FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE BEAVERS INTO THE FORESTS IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED THE SUN ROSE UPON THE DELAWARE ENCAMPMENT AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BURST UPON A BUSY PEOPLE
1502-122619-0007 THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
1502-122619-0008 A FEW EARNESTLY BENT ON SEEKING THE COMFORTS NECESSARY TO THEIR HABITS BUT MORE PAUSING TO EXCHANGE HASTY AND WHISPERED SENTENCES WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE WARRIORS WERE LOUNGING IN GROUPS
1502-122619-0009 THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
1502-122619-0010 WHEN NO OTHER ENEMY THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST IS EXPECTED TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES OF A WHOLE GROUP WERE TURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY
1502-122619-0011 AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
1502-122619-0012 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0013 BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
1502-122619-0014 FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
1502-122619-0015 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0016 HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
1502-122619-0017 ONE WHO SPOKE ALL THOSE LANGUAGES THAT WERE CULTIVATED AMONG THE NORTHERN ABORIGINES THE WISE HURON IS WELCOME SAID THE DELAWARE
1502-122619-0018 COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
1502-122619-0019 HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
1502-122619-0020 THEN THE DELAWARE INVITED HIS GUEST TO ENTER HIS OWN LODGE AND SHARE HIS MORNING MEAL THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED AND THE TWO WARRIORS ATTENDED BY THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLD MEN WALKED CALMLY AWAY
1502-122619-0021 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0022 AND RELATED ENTIRELY TO THE EVENTS OF THE HUNT IN WHICH MAGUA HAD SO LATELY BEEN ENGAGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST FINISHED BREEDING TO WEAR MORE OF THE APPEARANCE OF CONSIDERING THE VISIT AS A THING OF COURSE THAN DID HIS HOSTS
1502-122619-0023 NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
1502-122619-0024 IS THE FACE OF MY GREAT CANADA FATHER TURNED AGAIN TOWARD HIS HURON CHILDREN
1502-122619-0025 WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
1502-122619-0026 THE TOMAHAWKS OF YOUR YOUNG MEN HAVE BEEN VERY RED IT IS SO BUT THEY ARE NOW BRIGHT AND DULL FOR THE YENGEESE ARE DEAD AND THE DELAWARES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS
1502-122619-0027 THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
1502-122619-0028 DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
1502-122619-0029 SHE IS WELCOME RETURNED THE CHIEF OF THE LATTER NATION STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY THE BAFFLED MAGUA CONTINUED SILENT SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT HOWEVER TO THE REPULSE HE HAD RECEIVED
1502-122619-0030 IN THIS HIS OPENING EFFORT TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF CORA DO MY YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE DELAWARES ROOM ON THE MOUNTAINS FOR THEIR HUNTS HE AT LENGTH CONTINUED
1502-122619-0031 IT IS WELL JUSTICE IS THE MASTER OF A RED SKIN WHY SHOULD THEY BRIGHTEN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AND SHARPEN THEIR KNIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE NOT THE PALE FACES THICKER THAN THE SWALLOWS IN THE SEASON OF FLOWERS
1502-122619-0032 GOOD EXCLAIMED TWO OR THREE OF HIS AUDITORS AT THE SAME TIME
1502-122619-0033 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0034 LET MY CANADA FATHER COME RETURNED THE OTHER EVASIVELY HIS CHILDREN ARE READY TO SEE HIM WHEN THE GREAT CHIEF COMES IT IS TO SMOKE WITH THE INDIANS IN THEIR WIGWAMS THE HURONS SAY TOO HE IS WELCOME
1502-122619-0035 BUT THE YENGEESE HAVE LONG ARMS AND LEGS THAT NEVER TIRE
1502-122619-0036 IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
1502-122619-0037 AND GRAVELY SPREAD HIS PRESENTS BEFORE THE DAZZLED EYES OF HIS HOSTS THEY CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF TRINKETS OF LITTLE VALUE PLUNDERED FROM THE SLAUGHTERED FEMALES OF WILLIAM HENRY
1502-122619-0038 IN THE DIVISION OF THE BAUBLES THE CUNNING HURON DISCOVERED NO LESS ART THAN IN THEIR SELECTION WHILE HE BESTOWED THOSE OF GREATER VALUE ON THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS HOST HE SEASONED HIS OFFERINGS TO THEIR INFERIORS
1502-122619-0039 COMPLIMENTS AS LEFT THEM NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IN SHORT THE WHOLE CEREMONY CONTAINED SUCH A HAPPY BLENDING OF THE PROFITABLE WITH THE FLATTERING THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE DONOR IMMEDIATELY TO READ THE EFFECT OF A GENEROSITY
1502-122619-0040 SO APTLY MINGLED WITH PRAISE IN THE EYES OF THOSE HE ADDRESSED THIS WELL JUDGED AND POLITIC STROKE ON THE PART OF MAGUA WAS NOT WITHOUT INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS
1502-122619-0041 MY BROTHER IS A WISE CHIEF HE IS WELCOME THE HURONS LOVE THEIR FRIENDS THE DELAWARES RETURNED MAGUA WHY SHOULD THEY NOT THEY ARE COLORED BY THE SAME SUN AND THEIR JUST MEN WILL HUNT IN THE SAME GROUNDS AFTER DEATH
1502-122619-0042 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0043 AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
1502-122619-0044 WOULD THE YENGEESE SEND THEIR WOMEN AS SPIES DID NOT THE HURON CHIEF SAY HE TOOK WOMEN IN THE BATTLE HE TOLD NO LIE THE YENGEESE HAVE SENT OUT THEIR SCOUTS
1502-122619-0045 THEN THEY FLED TO THE DELAWARES FOR SAY THEY THE DELAWARES ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR MINDS ARE TURNED FROM THEIR CANADA FATHER THIS INSINUATION WAS A HOME THRUST
1502-122619-0046 WOULD HAVE ENTITLED MAGUA TO THE REPUTATION OF A SKILLFUL DIPLOMATIST THE RECENT DEFECTION OF THE TRIBE HAD AS THEY WELL KNEW THEMSELVES SUBJECTED THE DELAWARES TO MUCH REPROACH AMONG THEIR FRENCH ALLIES
1502-122619-0047 AND THEY WERE NOW MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS WERE TO BE REGARDED WITH JEALOUSY AND DISTRUST THERE WAS NO DEEP INSIGHT INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS NECESSARY TO FORESEE
1502-122619-0048 THAT SUCH A SITUATION OF THINGS WAS LIKELY TO PROVE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TO THEIR FUTURE MOVEMENTS THEIR DISTANT VILLAGES THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS
1502-122619-0049 TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
1502-122619-0050 WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
1502-122619-0051 HE WILL SEE NO CHANGE IT IS TRUE MY YOUNG MEN DID NOT GO OUT ON THE WAR PATH THEY HAD DREAMS FOR NOT DOING SO BUT THEY LOVE AND VENERATE THE GREAT WHITE CHIEF
1502-122619-0052 WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
1502-122619-0053 THAT THE PALE FACE WHO HAS SLAIN SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS GOES IN AND OUT AMONG THE DELAWARES GO MY GREAT CANADA FATHER IS NOT A FOOL
1502-122619-0054 LA LONGUE CARABINE THE DELAWARE WARRIORS STARTED AT THE WELL KNOWN NAME BETRAYING BY THEIR AMAZEMENT THAT THEY NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE SO FAMOUS AMONG THE INDIAN ALLIES OF FRANCE WAS WITHIN THEIR POWER
1502-122619-0055 WHAT DOES MY BROTHER MEAN DEMANDED LE COEUR DUR IN A TONE THAT BY ITS WONDER FAR EXCEEDED THE USUAL APATHY OF HIS RACE A HURON NEVER LIES RETURNED MAGUA COLDLY
1502-122619-0056 A LONG AND MUSING PAUSE SUCCEEDED THE CHIEF CONSULTED APART WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND MESSENGERS DESPATCHED TO COLLECT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE TRIBE AS WARRIOR AFTER WARRIOR DROPPED IN
1502-122619-0057 THE NEWS SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT BECAME POWERFULLY AGITATED THE WOMEN SUSPENDED THEIR LABORS TO CATCH SUCH SYLLABLES AS UNGUARDEDLY FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE CONSULTING WARRIORS
1502-122619-0058 THE BOYS DESERTED THEIR SPORTS AND WALKING FEARLESSLY AMONG THEIR FATHERS LOOKED UP IN CURIOUS ADMIRATION AS THEY HEARD THE BRIEF EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER THEY SO FREELY EXPRESSED THE TEMERITY OF THEIR HATED FOE
1502-122619-0059 IN SHORT EVERY OCCUPATION WAS ABANDONED FOR THE TIME AND ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEMED DISCARDED IN ORDER THAT THE TRIBE MIGHT FREELY INDULGE AFTER THEIR OWN PECULIAR MANNER IN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF FEELING
1502-122619-0060 THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
1502-122619-0061 MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
1502-122619-0062 AND APPARENTLY AS UNCONCERNED AS IF HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE RESULT
1502-122619-0063 ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
1502-122619-0064 HE ANTICIPATED EVERY MEASURE ON WHICH THEY DECIDED AND IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID
1502-122619-0065 AND FORMAL ASSEMBLAGE OF THE NATION AS SUCH MEETINGS WERE RARE AND ONLY CALLED ON OCCASIONS OF THE LAST IMPORTANCE THE SUBTLE HURON WHO STILL SAT APART
1502-122619-0066 NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
1502-122619-0067 IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
1502-122619-0068 THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
1502-122619-0069 ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
1502-122619-0070 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0071 UNTIL SUCH A ONE CHOSE TO MAKE SOME MOVEMENT NO DEEDS IN ARMS NO NATURAL GIFTS NOR ANY RENOWN AS AN ORATOR
1502-122619-0072 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THE AGED WARRIOR WHOSE PRIVILEGE IT WAS TO SPEAK WAS SILENT SEEMINGLY OPPRESSED WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS SUBJECT THE DELAY HAD ALREADY CONTINUED LONG BEYOND THE USUAL DELIBERATIVE PAUSE
1502-122619-0073 THAT ALWAYS PRECEDED A CONFERENCE BUT NO SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR SURPRISE ESCAPED EVEN THE YOUNGEST BOY OCCASIONALLY AN EYE WAS RAISED FROM THE EARTH WHERE THE LOOKS OF MOST WERE RIVETED
1502-122619-0074 AND THREE MEN ISSUING FROM IT SLOWLY APPROACHED THE PLACE OF CONSULTATION THEY WERE ALL AGED EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD TO WHICH THE OLDEST PRESENT HAD REACHED BUT ONE IN THE CENTER WHO LEANED ON HIS COMPANIONS FOR SUPPORT
1502-122619-0075 HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
1502-122619-0076 THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
1502-122619-0077 HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
1502-122619-0078 SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
1502-122619-0079 WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
1502-122619-0080 OF VARIOUS DEEDS IN ARMS DONE IN FORMER AGES HIS BOSOM WAS LOADED WITH MEDALS SOME IN MASSIVE SILVER AND ONE OR TWO EVEN IN GOLD
1502-122619-0081 HE ALSO WORE ARMLETS AND CINCTURES ABOVE THE ANKLES OF THE LATTER PRECIOUS METAL
1502-122619-0082 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0083 WHICH THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THIS VENERATED INDIVIDUAL CREATED HAD A LITTLE SUBSIDED
1502-122619-0084 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1502-122619-0085 WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
1502-122619-0086 THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
1502-122619-0087 WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
1502-122619-0088 THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
1502-122619-0089 THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
1502-122619-0090 WITH THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH AND THE AIR OF A FATHER
1502-122619-0091 WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
1502-122619-0092 AND APPROACHING THE PATRIARCH THEY PLACED HIS HANDS REVERENTLY ON THEIR HEADS SEEMING TO ENTREAT A BLESSING THE YOUNGER MEN WERE CONTENT WITH TOUCHING HIS ROBE OR EVEN DRAWING NIGH HIS PERSON
1502-122619-0093 SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
1502-122619-0094 THE CHIEFS DREW BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT
1502-122619-0095 AROSE LEFT THE CROWD AND ENTERED THE LODGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AS THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THAT MORNING
1502-122619-0096 ESCORTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD CAUSED ALL THESE SOLEMN PREPARATIONS TOWARD THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE CROWD OPENED IN A LANE AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD RE ENTERED
