3982-182255-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT THE GREAT FIGHT FOR CLEAN GOVERNMENT
3982-182255-0001 AS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS CITY SAID MISTER NEWBERRY LEANING BACK IN A LEATHER ARMCHAIR AT THE MAUSOLEUM CLUB AND LIGHTING A SECOND CIGAR IT'S ROTTEN THAT'S ALL
3982-182255-0002 ABSOLUTELY ROTTEN ASSENTED MISTER DICK OVEREND RINGING THE BELL FOR A SECOND WHISKEY AND SODA CORRUPT SAID MISTER NEWBERRY BETWEEN TWO PUFFS OF HIS CIGAR FULL OF GRAFT SAID MISTER OVEREND

3982-182255-0006 THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE CLUB IT WAS ON A SUNDAY EVENING
3982-182255-0007 NOT ARGUMENTATIVELY OR WITH ANY HEAT BUT WITH THE REFLECTIVE SADNESS THAT STEALS OVER AN ELDERLY MAN WHEN HE SITS IN THE LEATHER ARMCHAIR OF A COMFORTABLE CLUB SMOKING A GOOD CIGAR AND MUSING ON THE DECADENCE OF THE PRESENT DAY
3982-182255-0008 THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T ANGER THEM IT MERELY GRIEVED THEM THEY COULD REMEMBER BOTH OF THEM HOW DIFFERENT EVERYTHING WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MEN JUST ENTERING ON LIFE
3982-182255-0009 WHEN MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE YOUNG MEN WENT INTO CONGRESS FROM PURE PATRIOTISM THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS GRAFT OR CROOKEDNESS AS THEY BOTH ADMITTED IN THOSE DAYS AND AS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE
3982-182255-0010 HERE THEIR VOICES WERE ALMOST HUSHED IN AWE WHY WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG THE UNITED STATES SENATE BUT NO NEITHER OF THEM COULD FIND A PHRASE BIG ENOUGH FOR THEIR MEANING THEY MERELY REPEATED
3982-182255-0011 AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND TOOK LONG DRINKS OF WHISKEY AND SODA THEN NATURALLY SPEAKING OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD LED THEM TO TALK OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
3982-182255-0012 HOW DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURES THAT THEY REMEMBERED AS YOUNG MEN NOT MERELY DIFFERENT IN THE MATTER OF GRAFT BUT DIFFERENT SO MISTER NEWBERRY SAID IN THE CALIBRE OF THE MEN
3982-182255-0013 HE RECALLED HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A BOY OF TWELVE BY HIS FATHER TO HEAR A DEBATE HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT GIANTS HE SAID THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE IN FACT THE THING WAS MORE LIKE A WITENAGEMOT
3982-182255-0014 THAN A LEGISLATURE HE SAID HE DISTINCTLY RECALLED A MAN WHOSE NAME HE DIDN'T RECOLLECT SPEAKING ON A QUESTION HE DIDN'T JUST REMEMBER WHAT EITHER FOR OR AGAINST
3982-182255-0015 IT THRILLED HIM HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT IT STAYED IN HIS MEMORY AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY BUT AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE HERE MISTER DICK OVEREND SADLY NODDED ASSENT IN ADVANCE TO WHAT HE KNEW WAS COMING
3982-182255-0016 AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE WELL MISTER NEWBERRY HAD HAD HE SAID OCCASION TO VISIT THE STATE CAPITAL A WEEK BEFORE IN CONNECTION WITH A RAILWAY BILL THAT HE WAS TRYING TO THAT IS THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO
3982-182255-0017 FROM SPEAKING OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE LED TO TALK OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND THEY BOTH AGREED AS ABOVE THAT THINGS WERE WORSE THAN IN RUSSIA WHAT SECRETLY IRRITATED THEM BOTH MOST
3982-182255-0018 WAS THAT THEY HAD LIVED AND DONE BUSINESS UNDER THIS INFERNAL CORRUPTION FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AND HADN'T NOTICED IT THEY HAD BEEN TOO BUSY THE FACT WAS THAT THEIR CONVERSATION REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH THEIR OWN ORIGINAL IDEAS
3982-182255-0019 AS A GENERAL WAVE OF FEELING THAT WAS PASSING OVER THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THERE HAD COME A MOMENT QUITE SUDDENLY IT SEEMED WHEN IT OCCURRED TO EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY WAS ROTTEN THE WORD IS A STRONG ONE
3982-182255-0020 BUT IT IS THE ONE THAT WAS USED LOOK AT THE ALDERMEN THEY SAID ROTTEN LOOK AT THE CITY SOLICITOR ROTTEN AND AS FOR THE MAYOR HIMSELF PHEW THE THING CAME LIKE A WAVE
3982-182255-0021 EVERYBODY FELT IT AT ONCE PEOPLE WONDERED HOW ANY SANE INTELLIGENT COMMUNITY COULD TOLERATE THE PRESENCE OF A SET OF CORRUPT SCOUNDRELS LIKE THE TWENTY ALDERMEN OF THE CITY THEIR NAMES IT WAS SAID
3982-182255-0022 WERE SIMPLY A BYWORD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR RANK CRIMINAL CORRUPTION THIS WAS SAID SO WIDELY THAT EVERYBODY STARTED HUNTING THROUGH THE DAILY PAPERS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO IN BLAZES WERE ALDERMEN ANYHOW
3982-182255-0023 AND AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS WAVE OF FEELING STRUCK THE CITY NOBODY KNEW OR CARED WHO WERE ALDERMEN ANYWAY TO TELL THE TRUTH THE ALDERMEN HAD BEEN MUCH THE SAME PERSONS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS SOME WERE IN THE PRODUCE BUSINESS
3982-182255-0024 OTHERS WERE BUTCHERS TWO WERE GROCERS AND ALL OF THEM WORE BLUE CHECKERED WAISTCOATS AND RED TIES AND GOT UP AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING TO ATTEND THE VEGETABLE AND OTHER MARKETS NOBODY HAD EVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THEM THAT IS TO SAY NOBODY ON PLUTORIA AVENUE
3982-182255-0025 SOMETIMES ONE SAW A PICTURE IN THE PAPER AND WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHO THE PERSON WAS BUT ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND NOTICING WHAT WAS WRITTEN UNDER IT ONE SAID OH I SEE AN ALDERMAN AND TURNED TO SOMETHING ELSE WHOSE FUNERAL IS THAT
3982-182255-0026 A MAN WOULD SOMETIMES ASK ON PLUTORIA AVENUE OH JUST ONE OF THE CITY ALDERMEN
3982-182255-0027 OH I SEE I BEG YOUR PARDON I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SOMEBODY IMPORTANT
3982-182255-0028 HOW AND WHERE THIS MOVEMENT OF INDIGNATION HAD STARTED PEOPLE SAID THAT IT WAS PART OF A NEW WAVE OF PUBLIC MORALITY THAT WAS SWEEPING OVER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY IT WAS BEING REMARKED IN ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
3982-182255-0029 CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS WERE ATTRIBUTING ITS ORIGIN TO THE NEW VIGOUR AND THE FRESH IDEALS OF THE MIDDLE WEST IN BOSTON IT WAS SAID TO BE DUE TO A REVIVAL OF THE GRAND OLD NEW ENGLAND SPIRIT IN PHILADELPHIA
3982-182255-0030 THEY CALLED IT THE SPIRIT OF WILLIAM PENN IN THE SOUTH IT WAS SAID TO BE THE REASSERTION OF SOUTHERN CHIVALRY MAKING ITSELF FELT AGAINST THE GREED AND SELFISHNESS OF THE NORTH WHILE IN THE NORTH THEY RECOGNIZED IT AT ONCE
3982-182255-0031 AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE SLUGGISHNESS AND IGNORANCE OF THE SOUTH IN THE WEST THEY SPOKE OF IT AS A REVOLT AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST AND IN THE EAST THEY CALLED IT A REACTION AGAINST THE LAWLESSNESS OF THE WEST BUT EVERYWHERE THEY HAILED IT AS A NEW SIGN OF THE GLORIOUS
3982-182255-0032 UNITY OF THE COUNTRY IF THEREFORE MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER OVEREND WERE FOUND TO BE DISCUSSING THE CORRUPT STATE OF THEIR CITY THEY ONLY SHARED IN THE NATIONAL SENTIMENTS OF THE MOMENT IN FACT IN THE SAME CITY HUNDREDS OF OTHER CITIZENS
3982-182255-0033 AS DISINTERESTED AS THEMSELVES WERE WAKING UP TO THE REALIZATION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AS SOON AS PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOOK INTO THE CONDITION OF THINGS IN THE CITY THEY WERE HORRIFIED AT WHAT THEY FOUND IT WAS DISCOVERED FOR EXAMPLE

3982-182255-0036 IMAGINE IT AN IRISHMAN SITTING ON THE POLICE COMMITTEE OF THE COUNCIL IN A CITY WHERE THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED POLICEMEN WERE IRISH EITHER BY BIRTH OR PARENTAGE THE THING WAS MONSTROUS SO
3982-182255-0037 WHEN MISTER NEWBERRY SAID IT'S WORSE THAN RUSSIA HE MEANT IT EVERY WORD NOW JUST AS MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE FINISHING THEIR DISCUSSION THE HUGE BULKY FORM OF MAYOR MC GRATH CAME PONDEROUSLY PAST THEM AS THEY SAT
3982-182255-0038 HE LOOKED AT THEM SIDEWAYS OUT OF HIS EYES HE HAD EYES LIKE PLUMS IN A MOTTLED FACE AND BEING A BORN POLITICIAN HE KNEW BY THE VERY LOOK OF THEM THAT THEY WERE TALKING OF SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE TALKING ABOUT BUT
3982-182255-0039 BEING A POLITICIAN HE MERELY SAID GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN WITHOUT A SIGN OF DISTURBANCE GOOD EVENING MISTER MAYOR SAID MISTER NEWBERRY RUBBING HIS HANDS FEEBLY TOGETHER AND SPEAKING IN AN
3982-182255-0040 INGRATIATING TONE THERE IS NO MORE PITIABLE SPECTACLE THAN AN HONEST MAN CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF SPEAKING BOLDLY AND FEARLESSLY OF THE EVIL DOER GOOD EVENING MISTER MAYOR ECHOED MISTER DICK OVEREND ALSO RUBBING HIS HANDS
