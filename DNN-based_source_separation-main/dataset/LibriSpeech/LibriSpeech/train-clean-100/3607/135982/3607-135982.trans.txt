3607-135982-0000 THE CARS CAME SCUDDING IN TOWARDS DUBLIN RUNNING EVENLY LIKE PELLETS IN THE GROOVE OF THE NAAS ROAD
3607-135982-0001 CAREERING HOMEWARD AND THROUGH THIS CHANNEL OF POVERTY AND INACTION THE CONTINENT SPED ITS WEALTH AND INDUSTRY NOW AND AGAIN THE CLUMPS OF PEOPLE RAISED THE CHEER OF THE GRATEFULLY OPPRESSED THEIR SYMPATHY HOWEVER WAS FOR THE BLUE CARS
3607-135982-0002 THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
3607-135982-0003 EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
3607-135982-0004 IN FACT THESE FOUR YOUNG MEN WERE ALMOST HILARIOUS THEY WERE CHARLES SEGOUIN THE OWNER OF THE CAR ANDRE RIVIERE A YOUNG ELECTRICIAN OF CANADIAN BIRTH A HUGE HUNGARIAN NAMED VILLONA
3607-135982-0005 AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
3607-135982-0006 AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
3607-135982-0007 AND BESIDES HE WAS AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY HOWEVER WAS TOO EXCITED TO BE GENUINELY HAPPY HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A SOFT LIGHT BROWN MOUSTACHE AND RATHER INNOCENT LOOKING GREY EYES
3607-135982-0008 HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
3607-135982-0009 HE HAD ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME OF THE POLICE CONTRACTS AND IN THE END HE HAD BECOME RICH ENOUGH TO BE ALLUDED TO IN THE DUBLIN NEWSPAPERS AS A MERCHANT PRINCE HE HAD SENT HIS SON TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED IN A BIG CATHOLIC COLLEGE
3607-135982-0010 AND HAD AFTERWARDS SENT HIM TO DUBLIN UNIVERSITY TO STUDY LAW JIMMY DID NOT STUDY VERY EARNESTLY AND TOOK TO BAD COURSES FOR A WHILE HE HAD MONEY AND HE WAS POPULAR AND HE DIVIDED HIS TIME CURIOUSLY BETWEEN MUSICAL AND MOTORING CIRCLES
3607-135982-0011 HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
3607-135982-0012 WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
3607-135982-0013 VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
3607-135982-0014 DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
3607-135982-0015 THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT FOR HIM AS HE HAD NEARLY ALWAYS TO MAKE A DEFT GUESS AT THE MEANING AND SHOUT BACK A SUITABLE ANSWER IN THE FACE OF A HIGH WIND BESIDES VILLONA'S HUMMING WOULD CONFUSE ANYBODY THE NOISE OF THE CAR TOO
3607-135982-0016 RAPID MOTION THROUGH SPACE ELATES ONE SO DOES NOTORIETY SO DOES THE POSSESSION OF MONEY THESE WERE THREE GOOD REASONS FOR JIMMY'S EXCITEMENT HE HAD BEEN SEEN BY MANY OF HIS FRIENDS THAT DAY IN THE COMPANY OF THESE CONTINENTALS
3607-135982-0017 AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
3607-135982-0018 IT WAS PLEASANT AFTER THAT HONOUR TO RETURN TO THE PROFANE WORLD OF SPECTATORS AMID NUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LOOKS THEN AS TO MONEY HE REALLY HAD A GREAT SUM UNDER HIS CONTROL
3607-135982-0019 BUT JIMMY WHO IN SPITE OF TEMPORARY ERRORS WAS AT HEART THE INHERITOR OF SOLID INSTINCTS KNEW WELL WITH WHAT DIFFICULTY IT HAD BEEN GOT TOGETHER THIS KNOWLEDGE HAD PREVIOUSLY KEPT HIS BILLS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF REASONABLE RECKLESSNESS
3607-135982-0020 AND IF HE HAD BEEN SO CONSCIOUS OF THE LABOUR LATENT IN MONEY WHEN THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION MERELY OF SOME FREAK OF THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE HOW MUCH MORE SO NOW WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO STAKE THE GREATER PART OF HIS SUBSTANCE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING FOR HIM
3607-135982-0021 JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
3607-135982-0022 JIMMY SET OUT TO TRANSLATE INTO DAYS WORK THAT LORDLY CAR IN WHICH HE SAT HOW SMOOTHLY IT RAN IN WHAT STYLE THEY HAD COME CAREERING ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS THE JOURNEY LAID A MAGICAL FINGER ON THE GENUINE PULSE OF LIFE
3607-135982-0023 AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
3607-135982-0024 NEAR THE BANK SEGOUIN DREW UP AND JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND ALIGHTED A LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ON THE FOOTPATH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE SNORTING MOTOR THE PARTY WAS TO DINE TOGETHER THAT EVENING IN SEGOUIN'S HOTEL AND MEANWHILE JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM
3607-135982-0025 WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
3607-135982-0026 IN A HAZE OF SUMMER EVENING IN JIMMY'S HOUSE THIS DINNER HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AN OCCASION A CERTAIN PRIDE MINGLED WITH HIS PARENTS TREPIDATION A CERTAIN EAGERNESS ALSO TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE FOR THE NAMES OF GREAT FOREIGN CITIES HAVE AT LEAST THIS VIRTUE
3607-135982-0027 AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
3607-135982-0028 AND HIS MANNER EXPRESSED A REAL RESPECT FOR FOREIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THIS SUBTLETY OF HIS HOST WAS PROBABLY LOST UPON THE HUNGARIAN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A SHARP DESIRE FOR HIS DINNER THE DINNER WAS EXCELLENT EXQUISITE
3607-135982-0029 SEGOUIN JIMMY DECIDED HAD A VERY REFINED TASTE THE PARTY WAS INCREASED BY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN NAMED ROUTH WHOM JIMMY HAD SEEN WITH SEGOUIN AT CAMBRIDGE THE YOUNG MEN SUPPED IN A SNUG ROOM LIT BY ELECTRIC CANDLE LAMPS
3607-135982-0030 THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
3607-135982-0031 HE ADMIRED THE DEXTERITY WITH WHICH THEIR HOST DIRECTED THE CONVERSATION THE FIVE YOUNG MEN HAD VARIOUS TASTES AND THEIR TONGUES HAD BEEN LOOSENED VILLONA WITH IMMENSE RESPECT BEGAN TO DISCOVER TO THE MILDLY SURPRISED ENGLISHMAN THE BEAUTIES OF THE ENGLISH MADRIGAL
3607-135982-0032 RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
3607-135982-0033 WHEN SEGOUIN SHEPHERDED HIS PARTY INTO POLITICS HERE WAS CONGENIAL GROUND FOR ALL JIMMY UNDER GENEROUS INFLUENCES FELT THE BURIED ZEAL OF HIS FATHER WAKE TO LIFE WITHIN HIM HE AROUSED THE TORPID ROUTH AT LAST
3607-135982-0034 THE ROOM GREW DOUBLY HOT AND SEGOUIN'S TASK GREW HARDER EACH MOMENT THERE WAS EVEN DANGER OF PERSONAL SPITE THE ALERT HOST AT AN OPPORTUNITY LIFTED HIS GLASS TO HUMANITY AND WHEN THE TOAST HAD BEEN DRUNK HE THREW OPEN A WINDOW SIGNIFICANTLY
3607-135982-0035 THAT NIGHT THE CITY WORE THE MASK OF A CAPITAL THE FIVE YOUNG MEN STROLLED ALONG STEPHEN'S GREEN IN A FAINT CLOUD OF AROMATIC SMOKE THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND GAILY AND THEIR CLOAKS DANGLED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS THE PEOPLE MADE WAY FOR THEM
3607-135982-0036 AT THE CORNER OF GRAFTON STREET A SHORT FAT MAN WAS PUTTING TWO HANDSOME LADIES ON A CAR IN CHARGE OF ANOTHER FAT MAN THE CAR DROVE OFF AND THE SHORT FAT MAN CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PARTY ANDRE IT'S FARLEY
