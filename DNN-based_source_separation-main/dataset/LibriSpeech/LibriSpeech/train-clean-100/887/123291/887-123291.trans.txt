887-123291-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
887-123291-0001 IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
887-123291-0002 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0003 WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
887-123291-0004 SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
887-123291-0005 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0007 WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL
887-123291-0008 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0009 NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
887-123291-0010 BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0013 TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
887-123291-0014 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0016 WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE WE RAISED THE BODY WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
887-123291-0017 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0019 EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
887-123291-0020 I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
887-123291-0021 THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
887-123291-0022 I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
887-123291-0023 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0025 HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
887-123291-0026 HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0028 HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0030 I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
887-123291-0031 BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
887-123291-0032 YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
887-123291-0033 IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
887-123291-0034 IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM
887-123291-0035 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0037 HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
887-123291-0038 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0040 THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
887-123291-0041 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
887-123291-0042 HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
