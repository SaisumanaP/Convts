4051-11218-0000 GREATLY ENCOURAGED AT FINDING HIMSELF NOT YET TURNED INTO A CINDER
4051-11218-0001 JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
4051-11218-0002 TO BE SURE BUT THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BRAZEN BULLS WERE ENCHANTED CREATURES AND THAT JASON HAD BROKEN THE SPELL OF THEIR FIERY FIERCENESS BY HIS BOLD WAY OF HANDLING THEM AND EVER SINCE THAT TIME
4051-11218-0003 WHEN DANGER ASSAILS THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CALL TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND TO GRIPE HIM BY THE TAIL IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT IS TO THROW ASIDE FEAR AND OVERCOME THE PERIL BY DESPISING IT
4051-11218-0004 IT WAS NOW EASY TO YOKE THE BULLS AND TO HARNESS THEM TO THE PLOW
4051-11218-0005 WHO PERHAPS USED TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE HARNESSED TO THE PLOW AT ANY RATE OUR HERO SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL IN BREAKING UP THE GREENSWARD AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MOON WAS A QUARTER OF HER JOURNEY UP THE SKY THE PLOWED FIELD LAY BEFORE HIM
4051-11218-0006 A LARGE TRACT OF BLACK EARTH READY TO BE SOWN WITH THE DRAGON'S TEETH SO JASON SCATTERED THEM BROADCAST AND HARROWED THEM INTO THE SOIL WITH A BRUSH HARROW AND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
4051-11218-0007 MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
4051-11218-0008 AND WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE THE YELLOW GRAIN WOULD BE RIPENED FOR THE SICKLE BUT BY AND BY ALL OVER THE FIELD
4051-11218-0009 LIKE SPARKLING DROPS OF DEW THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS SPROUTED HIGHER AND PROVED TO BE THE STEEL HEADS OF SPEARS THEN THERE WAS A DAZZLING GLEAM FROM A VAST NUMBER OF POLISHED BRASS HELMETS BENEATH WHICH AS THEY GREW FARTHER OUT OF THE SOIL
4051-11218-0010 TORE THEMSELVES UP BY THE ROOTS WHEREVER A DRAGON'S TOOTH HAD FALLEN THERE STOOD A MAN ARMED FOR BATTLE THEY MADE A CLANGOR WITH THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND EYED ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY
4051-11218-0011 FULL OF RAGE AND STORMY PASSIONS AND READY TO TAKE THE LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BROTHER IN RECOMPENSE OF THE BOON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
4051-11218-0012 AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY GREAT CAPTAIN WHO WAS BENT ON CONQUERING THE WORLD LIKE ALEXANDER OR NAPOLEON TO RAISE A CROP OF ARMED SOLDIERS AS EASILY AS JASON DID
4051-11218-0013 CLASHING THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND BOILING OVER WITH THE RED HOT THIRST FOR BATTLE THEN THEY BEGAN TO SHOUT SHOW US THE ENEMY LEAD US TO THE CHARGE DEATH OR VICTORY COME ON BRAVE COMRADES CONQUER OR DIE
4051-11218-0014 AND A HUNDRED OTHER OUTCRIES SUCH AS MEN ALWAYS BELLOW FORTH ON A BATTLE FIELD AND WHICH THESE DRAGON PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE AT THEIR TONGUES ENDS AT LAST THE FRONT RANK CAUGHT SIGHT OF JASON WHO BEHOLDING THE FLASH OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4051-11218-0015 HAD THOUGHT IT BEST TO DRAW HIS SWORD IN A MOMENT ALL THE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH APPEARED TO TAKE JASON FOR AN ENEMY AND CRYING WITH ONE VOICE GUARD THE GOLDEN FLEECE THEY RAN AT HIM WITH UPLIFTED SWORDS AND PROTRUDED SPEARS
4051-11218-0016 THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
4051-11218-0017 AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
4051-11218-0018 HEWING AND STABBING AT ONE ANOTHER LOPPING OFF ARMS HEADS AND LEGS AND DOING SUCH MEMORABLE DEEDS THAT JASON WAS FILLED WITH IMMENSE ADMIRATION ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING TO BEHOLD THESE MIGHTY MEN PUNISHING EACH OTHER
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0020 THE LAST SURVIVOR THE BRAVEST AND STRONGEST OF THE WHOLE HAD JUST FORCE ENOUGH TO WAVE HIS CRIMSON SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND GIVE A SHOUT OF EXULTATION CRYING VICTORY VICTORY IMMORTAL FAME
4051-11218-0021 WHEN HE HIMSELF FELL DOWN AND LAY QUIETLY AMONG HIS SLAIN BRETHREN AND THERE WAS THE END OF THE ARMY THAT HAD SPROUTED FROM THE DRAGON'S TEETH THAT FIERCE AND FEVERISH FIGHT WAS THE ONLY ENJOYMENT WHICH THEY HAD TASTED ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH
4051-11218-0022 LET THEM SLEEP IN THE BED OF HONOR SAID THE PRINCESS MEDEA WITH A SLY SMILE AT JASON THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE SIMPLETONS ENOUGH JUST LIKE THEM FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND FANCYING THAT POSTERITY
4051-11218-0023 WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
4051-11218-0024 YOU WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MEDEA TRUE THE GOLDEN FLEECE MAY NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT THEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD AND ONE MUST NEEDS HAVE AN OBJECT YOU KNOW COME YOUR NIGHT'S WORK HAS BEEN WELL PERFORMED
4051-11218-0025 THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ALLOTTED TASK IS FULFILLED
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0027 AND HAVE CONCLUDED NOT TO GET YOURSELF SCORCHED TO A CINDER IN ATTEMPTING TO TAME MY BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS
4051-11218-0028 THE FIELD HAS BEEN PLOWED THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN BROADCAST AND HARROWED INTO THE SOIL
4051-11218-0029 AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
4051-11218-0030 AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
4051-11218-0031 AND THE DRAGON'S TEETH THE KING FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN SLAYING THE DRAGON AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN JASON SNAPPED UP AT A MOUTHFUL HE WAS RESOLVED AND IT WAS A VERY WRONG THING OF THIS WICKED POTENTATE
4051-11218-0032 NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
4051-11218-0033 TO SPEAK MY MIND PLAINLY YOU SHALL NEVER SET EYES ON SO MUCH AS ONE OF ITS GLISTENING LOCKS JASON LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE IN GREAT SORROW AND ANGER HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER
4051-11218-0034 MARCH AT ONCE TO THE GROVE OF MARS SLAY THE DRAGON TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE GET ON BOARD THE ARGO AND SPREAD ALL SAIL FOR IOLCHOS THE SUCCESS OF THIS SCHEME DEPENDED IT IS TRUE ON THE DOUBTFUL POINT
4051-11218-0035 AT SO MANY MOUTHFULS BY THE DRAGON BUT AS JASON WAS HASTENING DOWN THE PALACE STEPS
4051-11218-0036 AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH SERVICE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS BY NO MEANS VERY CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO HIM AN EQUALLY GREAT MISCHIEF BEFORE SUNSET THESE ENCHANTRESSES YOU MUST KNOW ARE NEVER TO BE DEPENDED UPON
4051-11218-0037 WILL HE GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER RISK OR TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED JASON HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAMING THE BRAZEN BULLS AND SOWING THE DRAGON'S TEETH
4051-11218-0038 AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
4051-11218-0039 STEALING THROUGH THE STREETS OF COLCHIS ON THEIR WAY TO THE SACRED GROVE
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0041 THEIR FIERCE NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY TAMED AND WITH THEIR FIERCENESS THE TWO FURNACES IN THEIR STOMACHS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
4051-11218-0042 THAN EVER BEFORE INDEED IT HAD HERETOFORE BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO THESE POOR ANIMALS THAT WHENEVER THEY WISHED TO EAT A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS THE FIRE OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS HAD SHRIVELED IT UP BEFORE THEY COULD MANAGE TO CROP IT
4051-11218-0043 HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
4051-11218-0044 JASON FOLLOWED MEDEA'S GUIDANCE INTO THE GROVE OF MARS WHERE THE GREAT OAK TREES THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR CENTURIES THREW SO THICK A SHADE THAT THE MOONBEAMS STRUGGLED VAINLY TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
4051-11218-0045 MEDEA SQUEEZED JASON'S HAND LOOK YONDER SHE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE IT GLEAMING AMONG THE VENERABLE OAKS THERE WAS A RADIANCE NOT LIKE THE MOONBEAMS BUT RATHER RESEMBLING THE GOLDEN GLORY OF THE SETTING SUN
4051-11218-0046 WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0048 PRIZE WHICH SO MANY HEROES HAD LONGED TO BEHOLD BUT HAD PERISHED IN THE QUEST OF IT EITHER BY THE PERILS OF THEIR VOYAGE OR BY THE FIERY BREATH OF THE BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS HOW GLORIOUSLY IT SHINES CRIED JASON IN A RAPTURE IT
4051-11218-0049 THE TERRIBLE DRAGON HAD QUITE SLIPPED OUT OF JASON'S MEMORY SOON HOWEVER SOMETHING CAME TO PASS THAT REMINDED HIM WHAT PERILS WERE STILL TO BE ENCOUNTERED AN ANTELOPE THAT PROBABLY MISTOOK THE YELLOW RADIANCE FOR SUNRISE CAME
4051-11218-0050 FOR HE WAS TWISTED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ON WHICH THE FLEECE HUNG AND SEIZING THE POOR ANTELOPE SWALLOWED HIM WITH ONE SNAP OF HIS JAWS AFTER THIS FEAT THE DRAGON SEEMED SENSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER LIVING CREATURE WAS WITHIN REACH
4051-11218-0051 ON WHICH HE FELT INCLINED TO FINISH HIS MEAL IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS HE KEPT POKING HIS UGLY SNOUT AMONG THE TREES STRETCHING OUT HIS NECK A TERRIBLE LONG WAY NOW HERE
4051-11218-0052 UPON MY WORD AS THE HEAD CAME WAVING AND UNDULATING THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHING ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF PRINCE JASON IT WAS A VERY HIDEOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SIGHT
4051-11218-0053 THE GAPE OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS WAS NEARLY AS WIDE AS THE GATEWAY OF THE KING'S PALACE WELL JASON WHISPERED MEDEA FOR SHE WAS ILL NATURED AS ALL ENCHANTRESSES ARE AND WANTED TO MAKE THE BOLD YOUTH TREMBLE
4051-11218-0054 WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW OF YOUR PROSPECT OF WINNING THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON ANSWERED ONLY BY DRAWING HIS SWORD AND MAKING A STEP FORWARD STAY FOOLISH YOUTH SAID MEDEA GRASPING HIS ARM
4051-11218-0055 FAR MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN YOUR SWORD THE DRAGON HAD PROBABLY HEARD THE VOICES FOR SWIFT AS LIGHTNING HIS BLACK HEAD AND FORKED TONGUE CAME HISSING AMONG THE TREES AGAIN DARTING FULL FORTY FEET AT A STRETCH AS IT APPROACHED
4051-11218-0056 MEDEA TOSSED THE CONTENTS OF THE GOLD BOX RIGHT DOWN THE MONSTER'S WIDE OPEN THROAT IMMEDIATELY WITH AN OUTRAGEOUS HISS AND A TREMENDOUS WRIGGLE FLINGING HIS TAIL UP TO THE TIP TOP OF THE TALLEST TREE
4051-11218-0057 AND SHATTERING ALL ITS BRANCHES AS IT CRASHED HEAVILY DOWN AGAIN THE DRAGON FELL AT FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND AND LAY QUITE MOTIONLESS IT IS ONLY A SLEEPING POTION SAID THE ENCHANTRESS TO PRINCE JASON
4051-11218-0058 SO I DID NOT WISH TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT QUICK SNATCH THE PRIZE AND LET US BEGONE YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON CAUGHT THE FLEECE FROM THE TREE
4051-11218-0059 WITH HER PEACOCK BESIDE HER SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY AND BECKONING HIM TO MAKE HASTE DISAPPEARED AMONG THE DUSKINESS OF THE TREES
4051-11218-0060 WHO WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN THE MOONLIGHT A FEW HUNDRED FEET ALOFT JASON BADE THEM TELL THE REST OF THE ARGONAUTS TO EMBARK AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE BUT LYNCEUS WITH HIS SHARP EYES HAD ALREADY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM BRINGING THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11218-0061 ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STONE WALLS A HILL AND THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE GROVE OF MARS INTERVENED BETWEEN BY HIS ADVICE THE HEROES HAD SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE BENCHES OF THE GALLEY
4051-11218-0062 HELD PERPENDICULARLY READY TO LET FALL INTO THE WATER AS JASON DREW NEAR HE HEARD THE TALKING IMAGE CALLING TO HIM WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY EAGERNESS IN ITS GRAVE SWEET VOICE MAKE HASTE PRINCE JASON FOR YOUR LIFE MAKE HASTE
