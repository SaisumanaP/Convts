7367-86737-0013 IN AN HOUR IN AN HOUR IT WILL BE AT THE DOOR AN HOUR AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS AT THE DOOR IT WAS A HACK CONVEYANCE WHICH WAS ELEVATED TO THE RANK OF A PRIVATE CARRIAGE IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION BUT IN SPITE OF ITS HUMBLE EXTERIOR
7367-86737-0014 THE YOUNG MEN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEMSELVES HAPPY TO HAVE SECURED IT FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS OF THE CARNIVAL EXCELLENCY CRIED THE CICERONE SEEING FRANZ APPROACH THE WINDOW
7367-86737-0015 SHALL I BRING THE CARRIAGE NEARER TO THE PALACE ACCUSTOMED AS FRANZ WAS TO THE ITALIAN PHRASEOLOGY HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO LOOK ROUND HIM BUT THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO HIM FRANZ WAS THE EXCELLENCY

7367-86737-0019 AS HE HAD SHOWN HIM SAINT PETER'S BY DAYLIGHT WHEN WE SHOW A FRIEND A CITY ONE HAS ALREADY VISITED WE FEEL THE SAME PRIDE AS WHEN WE POINT OUT A WOMAN WHOSE LOVER WE HAVE BEEN
7367-86737-0020 THE TEMPLE OF ANTONINUS AND FAUSTINA AND THE VIA SACRA THEY SAT DOWN TO DINNER SIGNOR PASTRINI HAD PROMISED THEM A BANQUET HE GAVE THEM A TOLERABLE REPAST AT THE END OF THE DINNER HE ENTERED IN PERSON
7367-86737-0021 BUT AT THE FIRST WORDS HE WAS INTERRUPTED EXCELLENCY SAID PASTRINI I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOUR APPROBATION BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THAT I CAME

7367-86737-0038 AND DOUBTLESS THE ROMAN PEOPLE WILL CROWN US AT THE CAPITOL AND PROCLAIM US LIKE CURTIUS AND THE VEILED HORATIUS THE PRESERVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY
7367-86737-0039 SIGNOR PASTRINI'S FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE AND PRAY ASKED FRANZ WHERE ARE THESE PISTOLS BLUNDERBUSSES AND OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS WITH WHICH YOU INTEND FILLING THE CARRIAGE NOT OUT OF MY ARMORY

7367-86737-0042 YOUR ANSWER IS SUBLIME AND WORTHY THE LET HIM DIE OF CORNEILLE ONLY WHEN HORACE MADE THAT ANSWER THE SAFETY OF ROME WAS CONCERNED
7367-86737-0043 ALBERT POURED HIMSELF OUT A GLASS OF LACRYMA CHRISTI WHICH HE SIPPED AT INTERVALS MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS WELL SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ NOW THAT MY COMPANION IS QUIETED AND YOU HAVE SEEN HOW PEACEFUL MY INTENTIONS ARE
7367-86737-0044 TELL ME WHO IS THIS LUIGI VAMPA IS HE A SHEPHERD OR A NOBLEMAN YOUNG OR OLD TALL OR SHORT DESCRIBE HIM IN ORDER THAT IF WE MEET HIM BY CHANCE LIKE BUGABOO JOHN OR LARA WE MAY RECOGNIZE HIM
7367-86737-0045 YOU COULD NOT APPLY TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS FOR I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD AND ONE DAY THAT I FELL INTO HIS HANDS GOING FROM FERENTINO TO ALATRI HE FORTUNATELY FOR ME
7367-86737-0046 RECOLLECTED ME AND SET ME FREE NOT ONLY WITHOUT RANSOM BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF A VERY SPLENDID WATCH AND RELATED HIS HISTORY TO ME LET US SEE THE WATCH SAID ALBERT
7367-86737-0047 BEARING THE NAME OF ITS MAKER OF PARISIAN MANUFACTURE AND A COUNT'S CORONET HERE IT IS SAID HE PESTE RETURNED ALBERT I COMPLIMENT YOU ON IT I HAVE ITS FELLOW HE TOOK HIS WATCH FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
7367-86737-0048 AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
7367-86737-0049 AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
7367-86737-0050 A YOUNG MAN HE IS ONLY TWO AND TWENTY HE WILL GAIN HIMSELF A REPUTATION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ALBERT AT TWO AND TWENTY TO BE THUS FAMOUS YES AND AT HIS AGE ALEXANDER CAESAR AND NAPOLEON
7367-86737-0051 HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
7367-86737-0052 ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICH
7367-86737-0053 EVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDE
7367-86737-0054 AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
7367-86737-0055 WITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREES
7367-86737-0056 IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
7367-86737-0057 HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
7367-86737-0058 THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
7367-86737-0059 TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
7367-86737-0060 THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
7367-86737-0061 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
7367-86737-0062 AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
7367-86737-0063 AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
7367-86737-0064 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
7367-86737-0065 THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
7367-86737-0066 HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
7367-86737-0067 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
7367-86737-0068 ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
7367-86737-0069 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
7367-86737-0070 AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
7367-86737-0071 THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
7367-86737-0072 TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
7367-86737-0073 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0074 DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
7367-86737-0075 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0077 THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF FEROCIOUS DARING AND BRUTALITY WERE RELATED OF HIM ONE DAY HE CARRIED OFF A YOUNG GIRL THE DAUGHTER OF A SURVEYOR OF FROSINONE THE BANDIT'S LAWS ARE POSITIVE A YOUNG GIRL BELONGS FIRST TO HIM WHO CARRIES HER OFF
7367-86737-0078 THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
7367-86737-0079 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0080 AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
7367-86737-0081 WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
7367-86737-0082 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
7367-86737-0083 CUCUMETTO SEEMED TO YIELD TO HIS FRIEND'S ENTREATIES AND BADE HIM FIND A SHEPHERD TO SEND TO RITA'S FATHER AT FROSINONE CARLINI FLEW JOYFULLY TO RITA TELLING HER SHE WAS SAVED AND BIDDING HER WRITE TO HER FATHER TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
7367-86737-0084 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
7367-86737-0085 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
7367-86737-0086 CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM
7367-86737-0087 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
7367-86737-0088 WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
7367-86737-0089 THE ONE WITH A SMILE OF LASCIVIOUSNESS ON HIS LIPS THE OTHER WITH THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS BROW A TERRIBLE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED IMMINENT BUT BY DEGREES CARLINI'S FEATURES RELAXED HIS HAND WHICH HAD GRASPED ONE OF THE PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
7367-86737-0090 THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
7367-86737-0091 WHY SHOULD AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN HER FAVOR I THOUGHT THAT MY ENTREATIES' WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU ANY MORE THAN THE REST TO ASK FOR AN EXCEPTION IS TRUE
7367-86737-0092 CONTINUED CUCUMETTO LAUGHING SOONER OR LATER YOUR TURN WILL COME CARLINI'S TEETH CLINCHED CONVULSIVELY NOW THEN SAID CUCUMETTO ADVANCING TOWARDS THE OTHER BANDITS ARE YOU COMING
7367-86737-0093 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
7367-86737-0094 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
7367-86737-0095 AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
7367-86737-0096 AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
7367-86737-0097 DIAVOLACCIO SAID HE CALMLY AND HE DRANK IT OFF WITHOUT HIS HAND TREMBLING IN THE LEAST THEN SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE MY SUPPER SAID HE MY EXPEDITION HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE
7367-86737-0098 THAT IS ACTING LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND THEY ALL FORMED A CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE
7367-86737-0099 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7367-86737-0100 THAT EVERY ONE ROSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARLINI WHO REMAINED SEATED AND ATE AND DRANK CALMLY DIAVOLACCIO ADVANCED AMIDST THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND LAID RITA AT THE CAPTAIN'S FEET
7367-86737-0101 I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY CARLINI STAYED BEHIND ALL SAVAGE NATURES APPRECIATE A DESPERATE DEED NO OTHER OF THE BANDITS WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT CARLINI HAD DONE NOW THEN CRIED CARLINI
7367-86737-0102 RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE CORPSE HIS HAND ON THE BUTT OF ONE OF HIS PISTOLS DOES ANY ONE DISPUTE THE POSSESSION OF THIS WOMAN WITH ME
7367-86737-0103 RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
7367-86737-0104 AT MIDNIGHT THE SENTINEL GAVE THE ALARM AND IN AN INSTANT ALL WERE ON THE ALERT IT WAS RITA'S FATHER WHO BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S RANSOM IN PERSON HERE SAID HE TO CUCUMETTO HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD
7367-86737-0105 BUT THE CHIEF WITHOUT TAKING THE MONEY
7367-86737-0106 THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
7367-86737-0107 HE WILL TELL THEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER AND HE RETURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS THE OLD MAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS HE FELT THAT SOME GREAT AND UNFORESEEN MISFORTUNE HUNG OVER HIS HEAD AT LENGTH HE ADVANCED TOWARD THE GROUP THE MEANING OF WHICH HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
7367-86737-0108 AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
7367-86737-0109 THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
7367-86737-0110 I LOVED HER THEREFORE I SLEW HER FOR SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE SPORT OF THE WHOLE BAND THE OLD MAN SPOKE NOT AND GREW PALE AS DEATH NOW CONTINUED CARLINI IF I HAVE DONE WRONGLY AVENGE HER
7367-86737-0111 AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
7367-86737-0112 RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN

7367-86737-0115 I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
7367-86737-0116 AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK CUCUMETTO AROUSED HIS MEN AND GAVE THE WORD TO MARCH BUT CARLINI WOULD NOT QUIT THE FOREST WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD BECOME OF RITA'S FATHER HE WENT TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
7367-86737-0117 HE FOUND THE OLD MAN SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHICH SHADED HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE HE THEN TOOK AN OATH OF BITTER VENGEANCE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF THE ONE AND THE TOMB OF THE OTHER
7367-86737-0118 HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
