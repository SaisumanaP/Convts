2289-152257-0000 IN THE TIME OF CLOVIS THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED BULGARIA WAS INHABITED BY GOTHS ONE DAY A POOR SHEPHERD BOY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LEFT HIS MOUNTAIN HOME IN THAT COUNTRY TO GO TO THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH WAS MANY MILES AWAY
2289-152257-0001 BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
2289-152257-0002 TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS BOY'S UNCLE WHO WAS NAMED JUSTIN HAD GONE TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND JOINED THE ROMAN ARMY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND SO GOOD A SOLDIER THAT HE SOON CAME TO BE
2289-152257-0003 COMMANDER OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD WHICH ATTENDED THE EMPEROR THE POOR SHEPHERD BOY HAD HEARD OF THE SUCCESS OF HIS UNCLE AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE RESOLVED TO SET OFF FOR THE BIG CITY SO HE STARTED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
2289-152257-0004 AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
2289-152257-0005 AND TO CROSS RIVERS AND HIGH HILLS BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON IN MIDSUMMER HE WALKED THROUGH THE MAIN GATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE PROUD AND HAPPY THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS PURPOSE HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIS UNCLE JUSTIN
2289-152257-0006 AND GAVE HIM THE BEST EDUCATION THAT COULD BE HAD IN THE CITY
2289-152257-0007 RICHLY DRESSED HE WAS WELL LIKED AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT AND WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEARNING TWO ONE DAY A GREAT CHANGE CAME FOR BOTH UNCLE AND NEPHEW THE EMPEROR DIED
2289-152257-0008 IN RULING THE EMPIRE JUSTINUS AGREED TO THIS PROPOSAL FOR HE WAS NOW OLD AND IN FEEBLE HEALTH AND NOT ABLE HIMSELF TO ATTEND TO THE IMPORTANT AFFAIRS OF GOVERNMENT
2289-152257-0009 JUSTINIAN REIGNED FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND DID SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED JUSTINIAN THE GREAT HE HAD MANY WARS DURING HIS REIGN BUT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE PART IN THEM
2289-152257-0010 HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
2289-152257-0011 HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
2289-152257-0012 THAT WERE CARRIED ON A FLEET OF SIX HUNDRED SHIPS IT TOOK THIS FLEET THREE MONTHS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TO AFRICA THE SAME VOYAGE MAY NOW BE MADE IN A VERY FEW DAYS BUT IN THE TIME OF BELISARIUS THERE WERE NO STEAMSHIPS
2289-152257-0013 AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
2289-152257-0014 HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0015 AND PREFERRED TO BE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ROMANS ABOUT TEN MILES FROM CARTHAGE HE MET A LARGE ARMY LED BY THE BROTHER OF GELIMER A BATTLE IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE AND THE VANDALS WERE UTTERLY DEFEATED
2289-152257-0016 GELIMER GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BELISARIUS WHO TOOK HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE JUSTINIAN SET APART AN ESTATE FOR HIM TO LIVE UPON AND THE CONQUERED KING PASSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PEACEFUL RETIREMENT
2289-152257-0017 AFTER CONQUERING THE VANDALS JUSTINIAN RESOLVED TO CONQUER ITALY WHICH WAS THEN HELD BY THE OSTROGOTHS A LARGE ARMY WAS GOT TOGETHER AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF BELISARIUS AND NARSES WHO IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR ITALY
2289-152257-0018 WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE THEY MARCHED STRAIGHT TO ROME AND AFTER SOME FIGHTING
2289-152257-0019 BUT IN A FEW MONTHS VIT'I GES KING OF THE GOTHS APPEARED WITH AN ARMY BEFORE THE GATES AND CHALLENGED BELISARIUS AND NARSES TO COME OUT AND FIGHT THE ROMAN GENERALS HOWEVER
2289-152257-0020 LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
2289-152257-0021 VITIGES RETIRED TO RAVENNA AND BELISARIUS QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND MADE SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY THAT IT WAS COMPELLED TO SURRENDER THE OSTROGOTH ARMY WAS CAPTURED
2289-152257-0022 FOR A LONG TIME THE GRANDEST CHURCH STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD THE GREAT TEMPLE STILL EXISTS IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR
2289-152257-0023 THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS MOST CELEBRATED WAS THE IMPROVING AND COLLECTING OF THE LAWS HE MADE MANY EXCELLENT NEW LAWS AND REFORMED MANY OF THE OLD LAWS SO THAT HE BECAME FAMOUS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE WORLD'S LEGISLATORS
2289-152257-0024 FOR A LONG TIME THE ROMAN LAWS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A VAST NUMBER OF THEM AND DIFFERENT WRITERS DIFFERED WIDELY AS TO WHAT THE LAWS REALLY WERE AND WHAT THEY MEANT JUSTINIAN EMPLOYED A GREAT LAWYER NAMED
2289-152257-0025 TRIB O'NI AN TO COLLECT AND SIMPLIFY THE PRINCIPAL LAWS THE COLLECTION WHICH HE MADE WAS CALLED THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN IT STILL EXISTS AND IS THE MODEL ACCORDING TO WHICH MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE MADE THEIR LAWS
