5463-39174-0000 AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
5463-39174-0001 FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0002 THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
5463-39174-0003 IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
5463-39174-0004 MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0005 AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
5463-39174-0006 AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
5463-39174-0007 A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0008 THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
5463-39174-0009 SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
5463-39174-0010 YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
5463-39174-0011 THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0012 LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
5463-39174-0013 HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
5463-39174-0014 AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0015 WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
5463-39174-0016 BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
5463-39174-0017 OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
5463-39174-0018 AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
5463-39174-0019 THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0020 AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
5463-39174-0021 BUT WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CAST OUT WITH UTTER SCORN BY MISTER CRAWLEY IF TENDERED IN HIS IMMEDIATE PRESENCE THERE HAD ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION AS TO ADDING TWO OR THREE BOTTLES OF PORT BUT THE COURAGE OF THE LADIES HAD FAILED THEM ON THAT HEAD AND THE WINE WAS NOT NOW ADDED TO THEIR DIFFICULTIES
5463-39174-0022 LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
5463-39174-0023 BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
5463-39174-0024 MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0025 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0026 WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
5463-39174-0027 MISS ROBARTS I AM AFRAID YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SAID HE GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT AND STICK LUCY BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE AT ALL IN THE WAY AND ALREADY BEGAN TO SPECULATE HOW SHE MIGHT BEST UNLOAD HER TREASURES
5463-39174-0028 AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5463-39174-0029 I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
5463-39174-0030 HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
5463-39174-0031 BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
5463-39174-0032 SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
5463-39174-0033 I DID VENTURE TO BRING THEM SAID FANNY WITH A LOOK OF SHAME FOR I KNOW HOW A SICK CHILD OCCUPIES THE WHOLE HOUSE AH MY FRIEND SAID MISSUS CRAWLEY TAKING HOLD OF MISSUS ROBARTS ARM AND LOOKING INTO HER FACE THAT SORT OF SHAME IS OVER WITH ME
5463-39174-0034 GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
5463-39174-0035 SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
5463-39174-0036 TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
5463-39174-0037 THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
5463-39174-0038 MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0039 OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
5463-39174-0040 THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
5463-39174-0041 BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
5463-39174-0042 BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
5463-39174-0043 IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
5463-39174-0044 AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
5463-39174-0045 LUCY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHILE WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ENTERED THEY FOUND THAT A SHOP HAD BEEN OPENED AT WHICH ALL MANNER OF LUXURIES WERE BEING READILY SOLD AND PURCHASED AT MARVELLOUSLY EASY PRICES THE GUAVA JELLY WAS THERE AND THE ORANGES AND THE SUGAR PLUMS RED AND YELLOW AND STRIPED
5463-39174-0046 AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5463-39174-0047 AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
5463-39174-0048 FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
5463-39174-0049 HOW FALSE IS HIS PRIDE AND HOW FALSE HIS SHAME BUT WE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAS TO BEAR IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT CAN ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS HIS WITHOUT FALSE PRIDE AND FALSE SHAME BUT SHE HAS NEITHER SAID LUCY
5463-39174-0050 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
