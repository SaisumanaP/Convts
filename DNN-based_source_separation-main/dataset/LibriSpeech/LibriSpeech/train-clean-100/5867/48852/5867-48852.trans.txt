5867-48852-0000 BELL HAD DECLARED THAT HER SISTER WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE JOHN EAMES IF HE WOULD GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND HE HAD REPLIED THAT OF COURSE HE WOULD GO THERE SO MUCH HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE SETTLED
5867-48852-0001 HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK OF HIS VISIT AS A MATTER OF COURSE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE ON THE MORNING AFTER THE EARL'S DINNER PARTY I MUST GET YOU TO COME ROUND WITH ME DALE AND SEE WHAT I AM DOING TO THE LAND THE EARL SAID
5867-48852-0002 BUT THE SQUIRE PREFERRED WALKING AND IN THIS WAY THEY WERE DISPOSED OF SOON AFTER BREAKFAST JOHN HAD IT IN HIS MIND TO GET BELL TO HIMSELF FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH HER BUT IT EITHER HAPPENED THAT LADY JULIA WAS TOO KEEN IN HER DUTIES AS A HOSTESS
5867-48852-0003 OR ELSE AS WAS MORE POSSIBLE BELL AVOIDED THE MEETING NO OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH AN INTERVIEW OFFERED ITSELF THOUGH HE HUNG ABOUT THE DRAWING ROOM ALL THE MORNING YOU HAD BETTER WAIT FOR LUNCHEON NOW LADY JULIA SAID TO HIM ABOUT TWELVE
5867-48852-0004 BUT THIS HE DECLINED AND TAKING HIMSELF AWAY HID HIMSELF ABOUT THE PLACE FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF DURING THIS TIME HE CONSIDERED MUCH WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO RIDE OR WALK IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0005 HE COULD RIDE BACK TRIUMPHANT AS A FIELD MARSHAL THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO HIM BUT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM NO HOPE IF IT SHOULD BE HIS DESTINY TO BE REJECTED UTTERLY ON THAT MORNING THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE TERRIBLY IN THE WAY OF HIS SORROW
5867-48852-0006 RESTING WHEN HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO REST AND RUNNING WHEN IT MIGHT SUIT HIM TO RUN AND SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE WON'T CARE FOR MY BOOTS BEING DIRTY SO AT LAST HE ELECTED TO WALK
5867-48852-0007 STAND UP TO HER BOLDLY MAN THE EARL HAD SAID TO HIM BY GEORGE WHAT IS THERE TO BE AFRAID OF
5867-48852-0008 THERE'S NOTHING SETS EM AGAINST A MAN LIKE BEING SHEEPISH HOW THE EARL KNEW SO MUCH
5867-48852-0009 I AM NOT PREPARED TO SAY BUT EAMES TOOK HIS ADVICE AS BEING IN ITSELF GOOD AND RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT NOT THAT ANY RESOLUTION WILL BE OF ANY USE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED ALONG
5867-48852-0010 WHEN THE MOMENT COMES I KNOW THAT I SHALL TREMBLE BEFORE HER AND I KNOW THAT SHE'LL SEE IT
5867-48852-0011 HE HAD LAST SEEN HER ON THE LAWN BEHIND THE SMALL HOUSE JUST AT THAT TIME WHEN HER PASSION FOR CROSBIE WAS AT THE STRONGEST EAMES HAD GONE THITHER IMPELLED BY A FOOLISH DESIRE TO DECLARE TO HER HIS HOPELESS LOVE
5867-48852-0012 AND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED MISTER CROSBIE BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES OF COURSE SHE HAD DONE SO AT THAT TIME BUT NEVERTHELESS HER MANNER OF TELLING HIM HAD SEEMED TO HIM TO BE CRUEL AND HE ALSO HAD BEEN CRUEL
5867-48852-0013 HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE HATED CROSBIE CALLING HIM THAT MAN AND ASSURING HER THAT NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO GO INTO THAT MAN'S HOUSE THEN HE HAD WALKED AWAY MOODILY WISHING HIM ALL MANNER OF EVIL
5867-48852-0014 WAS IT NOT SINGULAR THAT ALL THE EVIL THINGS WHICH HE IN HIS MIND HAD MEDITATED FOR THE MAN HAD FALLEN UPON HIM CROSBIE HAD LOST HIS LOVE HE HAD SO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A VILLAIN THAT HIS NAME MIGHT NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED
5867-48852-0015 HE HAD BEEN IGNOMINIOUSLY THRASHED BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL THIS BE IF HIS IMAGE WERE STILL DEAR TO LILY'S HEART I TOLD HER THAT I LOVED HER THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF THOUGH I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO
5867-48852-0016 AT ANY RATE I HAVE A RIGHT TO TELL HER NOW WHEN HE REACHED ALLINGTON HE DID NOT GO IN THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND UP TO THE FRONT OF THE SMALL HOUSE BY THE CROSS STREET BUT TURNED BY THE CHURCH GATE AND PASSED OVER THE SQUIRE'S TERRACE
5867-48852-0017 HERE HE ENCOUNTERED HOPKINS
5867-48852-0018 MISTER JOHN MAY I MAKE SO BOLD AND HOPKINS HELD OUT A VERY DIRTY HAND WHICH EAMES OF COURSE TOOK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS NEW AFFECTION I'M JUST GOING TO CALL AT THE SMALL HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D COME THIS WAY
5867-48852-0019 TO BE SURE THIS WAY OR THAT WAY OR ANY WAY WHO'S SO WELCOME MISTER JOHN I ENVIES YOU I ENVIES YOU MORE THAN I ENVIES ANY MAN IF I COULD A GOT HIM BY THE SCUFF OF THE NECK I'D A TREATED HIM JIST LIKE ANY WERMIN I WOULD INDEED HE WAS WERMIN I
5867-48852-0020 OLLAYS SAID IT I HATED HIM OLLAYS I DID INDEED MISTER JOHN
5867-48852-0021 HE NEVER LOOKED AT ONE AS THOUGH ONE WERE A CHRISTIAN DID HE MISTER JOHN
5867-48852-0022 ONLY SHE POOR YOUNG LADY SHE'LL BE BETTER NOW MISTER JOHN A DEAL BETTER
5867-48852-0023 TELL ME MISTER JOHN DID YOU GIVE IT HIM WELL WHEN YOU GOT HIM I HEARD YOU DID TWO BLACK EYES AND ALL HIS FACE ONE MASH OF GORE AND HOPKINS WHO WAS BY NO MEANS A YOUNG MAN STIFFLY PUT HIMSELF INTO A FIGHTING ATTITUDE
5867-48852-0024 EAMES PASSED ON OVER THE LITTLE BRIDGE WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF FAST DECAY UNATTENDED TO BY ANY FRIENDLY CARPENTER NOW THAT THE DAYS OF ITS USE WERE SO NEARLY AT AN END AND ON INTO THE GARDEN LINGERING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LAST SAID FAREWELL TO LILY
5867-48852-0025 BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN IN THE GARDEN AND NO SOUND TO BE HEARD AS EVERY STEP BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HER WHOM HE WAS SEEKING HE BECAME MORE AND MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF HIS ERRAND HIM SHE HAD NEVER LOVED
5867-48852-0026 AND WHY SHOULD HE VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE WOULD LOVE HIM NOW
5867-48852-0027 HAD HE NOT BEEN AWARE THAT HIS PROMISE TO OTHERS REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD PERSEVERE HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD DO THIS THING AND HE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD BUT HE HARDLY VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL
5867-48852-0028 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND HE SLOWLY MADE HIS WAY UP ACROSS THE LAWN MY DEAR THERE IS JOHN EAMES SAID MISSUS DALE WHO HAD FIRST SEEN HIM FROM THE PARLOUR WINDOW DON'T GO MAMMA
5867-48852-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD NO MAMMA NO WHAT GOOD CAN IT DO IT CAN DO NO GOOD I LIKE HIM AS WELL AS I CAN LIKE ANY ONE I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT IT CAN DO NO GOOD LET HIM COME IN HERE AND BE VERY KIND TO HIM
5867-48852-0030 AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM THEN MISSUS DALE WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER ROOM AND ADMITTED HER VISITOR THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DRAWING ROOM WE ARE IN TERRIBLE CONFUSION JOHN ARE WE NOT AND SO YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO LIVE IN GUESTWICK
5867-48852-0031 WELL IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOES IT NOT BUT TO TELL YOU A SECRET ONLY IT MUST BE A SECRET YOU MUST NOT MENTION IT AT GUESTWICK MANOR EVEN BELL DOES NOT KNOW WE HAVE HALF MADE UP OUR MINDS TO UNPACK ALL OUR THINGS AND STAY WHERE WE ARE
5867-48852-0032 EAMES WAS SO INTENT ON HIS OWN PURPOSE AND SO FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK BEFORE HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY RECEIVE MISSUS DALE'S TIDINGS WITH ALL THE INTEREST WHICH THEY DESERVED UNPACK THEM ALL AGAIN HE SAID
5867-48852-0033 THAT WILL BE VERY TROUBLESOME IS LILY WITH YOU MISSUS DALE YES SHE IS IN THE PARLOUR COME AND SEE HER SO HE FOLLOWED MISSUS DALE THROUGH THE HALL AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS LOVE
5867-48852-0034 HOW DO YOU DO JOHN HOW DO YOU DO LILY WE ALL KNOW THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH MEETINGS ARE COMMENCED EACH LONGED TO BE TENDER AND AFFECTIONATE TO THE OTHER
5867-48852-0035 BUT NEITHER KNEW HOW TO THROW ANY TENDERNESS INTO THIS FIRST GREETING SO YOU'RE STAYING AT THE MANOR HOUSE SAID LILY YES I'M STAYING THERE YOUR UNCLE AND BELL CAME YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BELL SAID MISSUS DALE
5867-48852-0036 OH YES MARY TOLD ME I'M SO GLAD OF IT I ALWAYS LIKED DOCTOR CROFTS VERY MUCH I HAVE NOT CONGRATULATED HER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A SECRET BUT CROFTS WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND IF IT IS A SECRET HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING IT
5867-48852-0037 I DON'T KNOW THAT I AM FOND OF SUCH SECRETS BUT AS SHE SAID THIS SHE THOUGHT OF CROSBIE'S ENGAGEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN TOLD TO EVERY ONE AND OF ITS CONSEQUENCES IS IT TO BE SOON HE ASKED WELL YES WE THINK SO
5867-48852-0038 OF COURSE NOTHING IS SETTLED IT WAS SUCH FUN SAID LILY JAMES WHO TOOK AT ANY RATE A YEAR OR TWO TO MAKE HIS PROPOSAL WANTED TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY AFTERWARDS NO LILY NOT QUITE THAT WELL MAMMA IT WAS VERY NEARLY THAT
5867-48852-0039 I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I SHOULD SO MUCH LIKE FOR A BROTHER I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKE HIM VERY GLAD I HOPE YOU'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME LITTLE TENDERNESS IN THIS AS JOHN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF I'M SURE WE SHALL IF HE LIKES IT THAT IS IF I EVER HAPPEN TO SEE HIM
5867-48852-0040 I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR HIM I CAN IF HE EVER COMES UP TO LONDON WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD THING MISSUS DALE IF HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN LONDON NO JOHN IT WOULD BE A VERY BAD THING WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER MISSUS DALE WAS SPEAKING OF HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0041 BUT THE VERY ALLUSION TO ANY SUCH ROBBERY COVERED JOHN EAMES'S FACE WITH A BLUSH
5867-48852-0042 AND FOR THE MOMENT SILENCED HIM YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE A BETTER CAREER IN LONDON SAID LILY SPEAKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER SUPERIOR PRESENCE OF MIND SHE HAD CERTAINLY SHOWN DEFECTIVE JUDGMENT IN DESIRING HER MOTHER NOT TO LEAVE THEM ALONE
5867-48852-0043 AND OF THIS MISSUS DALE SOON FELT HERSELF AWARE THE THING HAD TO BE DONE AND NO LITTLE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE SUCH AS THIS OF MISSUS DALE'S ENFORCED PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT IT OF THIS MISSUS DALE WAS WELL AWARE
5867-48852-0044 AND SHE FELT MOREOVER THAT JOHN WAS ENTITLED TO AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE
5867-48852-0045 BUT NOT THE LESS SHOULD HE HAVE IT OF RIGHT SEEING THAT HE DESIRED IT BUT YET MISSUS DALE DID NOT DARE TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM LILY HAD ASKED HER NOT TO DO SO AND AT THE PRESENT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ALL LILY'S REQUESTS WERE SACRED
5867-48852-0046 THEY CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME TO TALK OF CROFTS AND HIS MARRIAGE AND WHEN THAT SUBJECT WAS FINISHED THEY DISCUSSED THEIR OWN PROBABLE OR AS IT SEEMED NOW IMPROBABLE REMOVAL TO GUESTWICK IT'S GOING TOO FAR MAMMA SAID LILY
5867-48852-0047 TO SAY THAT YOU THINK WE SHALL NOT GO IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT YOU SUGGESTED IT THE TRUTH IS JOHN THAT HOPKINS CAME IN AND DISCOURSED WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL ELOQUENCE NOBODY DARED TO OPPOSE HOPKINS HE MADE US ALMOST CRY HE WAS SO PATHETIC
5867-48852-0048 HE HAS JUST BEEN TALKING TO ME TOO SAID JOHN AS I CAME THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S GARDEN AND WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING TO YOU SAID MISSUS DALE OH I DON'T KNOW NOT MUCH
5867-48852-0049 JOHN HOWEVER REMEMBERED WELL AT THIS MOMENT ALL THAT THE GARDENER HAD SAID TO HIM DID SHE KNOW OF THAT ENCOUNTER BETWEEN HIM AND CROSBIE AND IF SHE DID KNOW OF IT IN WHAT LIGHT DID SHE REGARD IT
5867-48852-0050 HE HAD SWORN TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE THE SMALL HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING LILY TO BE HIS WIFE IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE WOULD BE GUILTY OF FALSEHOOD TOWARDS THE EARL IF HE DID SO LORD DE GUEST HAD OPENED HIS HOUSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0051 AND HAD ASKED ALL THE DALES THERE AND HAD OFFERED HIMSELF UP AS A SACRIFICE AT THE CRUEL SHRINE OF A SERIOUS DINNER PARTY TO SAY NOTHING OF THAT EASIER AND LIGHTER SACRIFICE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN A PECUNIARY POINT OF VIEW IN ORDER THAT THIS THING MIGHT BE DONE
5867-48852-0052 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES EAMES WAS TOO HONEST A MAN NOT TO DO IT LET THE DIFFICULTIES IN HIS WAY BE WHAT THEY MIGHT HE HAD SAT THERE FOR AN HOUR AND MISSUS DALE STILL REMAINED WITH HER DAUGHTER
5867-48852-0053 SHOULD HE GET UP BOLDLY AND ASK LILY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE ROSE AND GRASPED AT HIS HAT I AM GOING TO WALK BACK TO GUESTWICK SAID HE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO FAR TO SEE US
5867-48852-0054 I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF WALKING HE SAID
5867-48852-0055 HAVE A GLASS OF WINE BEFORE YOU GO OH DEAR NO I THINK I'LL GO BACK THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S FIELDS AND OUT ON THE ROAD AT THE WHITE GATE THE PATH IS QUITE DRY NOW I DARE SAY IT IS SAID MISSUS DALE LILY
5867-48852-0056 I WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD COME AS FAR AS THAT WITH ME AS THE REQUEST WAS MADE MISSUS DALE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER ALMOST BESEECHINGLY DO PRAY DO SAID HE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR WALKING
5867-48852-0057 THE PATH PROPOSED LAY RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD INTO WHICH LILY HAD TAKEN CROSBIE WHEN SHE MADE HER OFFER TO LET HIM OFF FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WALK THERE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LOVER NO JOHN SHE SAID NOT TO DAY
5867-48852-0058 I THINK I AM ALMOST TIRED AND I HAD RATHER NOT GO OUT IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD SAID MISSUS DALE I DON'T WANT TO BE DONE GOOD TO MAMMA BESIDES I SHOULD HAVE TO COME BACK BY MYSELF I'LL COME BACK WITH YOU SAID JOHNNY
5867-48852-0059 OH YES AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE TO GO AGAIN WITH YOU BUT JOHN REALLY I DON'T WISH TO WALK TO DAY WHEREUPON JOHN EAMES AGAIN PUT DOWN HIS HAT LILY SAID HE AND THEN HE STOPPED MISSUS DALE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
5867-48852-0060 LILY I HAVE COME OVER HERE ON PURPOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU INDEED I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON ONLY THAT I MIGHT SEE YOU HAVE YOU JOHN YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WELL ALL THAT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU
5867-48852-0061 NO JOHN NO SHE ANSWERED
5867-48852-0062 ALWAYS NO TO THAT HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME MARRY YOU WHILE I LOVE ANOTHER BUT HE IS GONE HE HAS TAKEN ANOTHER WIFE I CANNOT CHANGE MYSELF BECAUSE HE IS CHANGED
5867-48852-0063 IF YOU ARE KIND TO ME YOU WILL LET THAT BE ENOUGH BUT YOU ARE SO UNKIND TO ME NO NO OH I WOULD WISH TO BE SO KIND TO YOU JOHN HERE TAKE MY HAND IT IS THE HAND OF A FRIEND WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
5867-48852-0064 DEAR JOHN I WILL DO ANYTHING EVERYTHING FOR YOU BUT THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING SAID HE STILL HOLDING HER BY THE HAND BUT WITH HIS FACE TURNED FROM HER NAY DO NOT SAY SO
5867-48852-0065 I COULD NOT HAVE THAT ONE THING AND I WAS NEARER TO MY HEART'S LONGINGS THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN I CANNOT HAVE THAT ONE THING BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BROKEN HEARTED
5867-48852-0066 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
5867-48852-0067 I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE I WISH IT COULD BE OTHERWISE IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM ANY HOPE MAMMA TELL ME THAT I MAY COME AGAIN IN A YEAR HE PLEADED I CANNOT TELL YOU SO YOU MAY NOT COME AGAIN NOT IN THIS WAY
5867-48852-0068 THAT I LOVED HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES IT IS STILL THE SAME I STILL LOVE HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD HOW THEN CAN I GIVE YOU ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0069 BUT IT WILL NOT BE SO FOR EVER LILY FOR EVER WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE MINE AS WELL AS HERS WHEN THAT FOR EVER COMES JOHN IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LOVE
5867-48852-0070 YOU WILL SAY NOTHING MORE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU MORE OPENLY ABOUT THIS THAN I HAVE EVER DONE TO ANYBODY EVEN TO MAMMA BECAUSE I HAVE WISHED TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEELINGS
5867-48852-0071 I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN AFTER AFTER IT IS TO ME ALMOST AS THOUGH I HAD MARRIED HIM
5867-48852-0072 I AM NOT BLAMING HIM REMEMBER THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A MAN SHE HAD NOT DROPPED HIS HAND AND AS SHE MADE HER LAST SPEECH WAS SITTING IN HER OLD CHAIR WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
5867-48852-0073 SHE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY ALMOST WITH DIFFICULTY BUT STILL THE WORDS CAME VERY CLEARLY WITH A CLEAR DISTINCT VOICE WHICH CAUSED THEM TO BE REMEMBERED WITH ACCURACY
5867-48852-0074 TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE HIS SUIT AFTER SUCH A DECLARATION TO MISSUS DALE THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS SPEAKING OF A PERPETUAL WIDOWHOOD
5867-48852-0075 AND TELLING OF AN AMOUNT OF SUFFERING GREATER EVEN THAN THAT WHICH SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
5867-48852-0076 OR HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SO CLEAR AN EXPOSITION OF HER OWN FEELINGS I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS BUT VERY EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD
5867-48852-0077 MISSUS DALE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT EAMES WAS COMING TOO SOON THAT THE EARL AND THE SQUIRE TOGETHER WERE MAKING AN EFFORT TO CURE THE WOUND TOO QUICKLY AFTER ITS INFLICTION THAT TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO HER GIRL TO RECOVER
5867-48852-0078 BUT NOW THE ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE AND WORDS HAD BEEN FORCED FROM LILY'S LIPS THE SPEAKING OF WHICH WOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HERSELF I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAID JOHN AH YES
5867-48852-0079 YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE YOUR HEART UNDERSTANDS MY HEART AND YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME AND SAY NAUGHTY CRUEL WORDS AS YOU DID ONCE BEFORE WE WILL THINK OF EACH OTHER JOHN AND PRAY FOR EACH OTHER AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER
5867-48852-0080 WHEN WE DO MEET LET US BE GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER NO OTHER FRIEND SHALL EVER BE DEARER TO ME THAN YOU ARE YOU ARE SO TRUE AND HONEST WHEN YOU MARRY I WILL TELL YOUR WIFE WHAT AN INFINITE BLESSING GOD HAS GIVEN HER
5867-48852-0081 YOU SHALL NEVER DO THAT YES I WILL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YET I WILL GOOD BY MISSUS DALE HE SAID GOOD BY JOHN
5867-48852-0082 AND I WILL LOVE YOU NOW THEN SHE PUT UP HER LIPS AND KISSED HIS FACE AND SO WILL I LOVE YOU SAID LILY GIVING HIM HER HAND AGAIN
5867-48852-0083 HE LOOKED LONGINGLY INTO HER FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE ALSO MIGHT KISS HIM THEN HE PRESSED HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND WITHOUT SPEAKING ANY FURTHER FAREWELL TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEFT THE ROOM POOR FELLOW
5867-48852-0084 SAID MISSUS DALE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE LET HIM COME SAID LILY BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
5867-48852-0085 AND THEY MEAN TO BE GOOD NATURED AND TO GIVE ME ANOTHER VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT LILY WENT AWAY BY HERSELF AND SAT ALONE FOR HOURS AND WHEN SHE JOINED HER MOTHER AGAIN AT TEA TIME NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID OF JOHN EAMES'S VISIT
5867-48852-0086 HE MADE HIS WAY OUT BY THE FRONT DOOR AND THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD AND IN THIS WAY ON TO THE FIELD THROUGH WHICH HE HAD ASKED LILY TO WALK WITH HIM
5867-48852-0087 AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE TOMBSTONES HE PAUSED AND READ ONE AS THOUGH IT INTERESTED HIM
5867-48852-0088 AND THEN PULLED OUT HIS OWN WATCH AS THOUGH TO VERIFY THE ONE BY THE OTHER HE MADE UNCONSCIOUSLY A STRUGGLE TO DRIVE AWAY FROM HIS THOUGHTS THE FACTS OF THE LATE SCENE AND FOR SOME FIVE OR TEN MINUTES HE SUCCEEDED
5867-48852-0089 AND LAUGHED INWARDLY AS HE REMEMBERED THE FIGURE OF RAFFERTY BRINGING IN THE KNIGHT'S SHOES HE HAD GONE SOME HALF MILE UPON HIS WAY BEFORE HE VENTURED TO STAND STILL AND TELL HIMSELF THAT HE HAD FAILED IN THE GREAT OBJECT OF HIS LIFE YES
5867-48852-0090 HE HAD FAILED AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF WITH BITTER REPROACHES THAT HE HAD FAILED NOW AND FOR EVER HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE HAD OBTRUDED UPON HER IN HER SORROW WITH AN UNMANNERLY LOVE
5867-48852-0091 AND REBUKED HIMSELF AS HAVING BEEN NOT ONLY FOOLISH BUT UNGENEROUS HIS FRIEND THE EARL HAD BEEN WONT IN HIS WAGGISH WAY TO CALL HIM THE CONQUERING HERO AND HAD SO TALKED HIM OUT OF HIS COMMON SENSE AS TO HAVE MADE HIM ALMOST THINK THAT HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN HIS SUIT
5867-48852-0092 HE ALMOST HATED THE EARL FOR HAVING BROUGHT HIM TO THIS CONDITION A CONQUERING HERO INDEED HOW SHOULD HE MANAGE TO SNEAK BACK AMONG THEM ALL AT THE MANOR HOUSE CRESTFALLEN AND ABJECT IN HIS MISERY
5867-48852-0093 EVERYBODY KNEW THE ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD GONE AND EVERYBODY MUST KNOW OF HIS FAILURE HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL AS TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A TASK UNDER THE EYES OF SO MANY LOOKERS ON
5867-48852-0094 WAS IT NOT THE CASE THAT HE HAD SO FONDLY EXPECTED SUCCESS AS TO THINK ONLY OF HIS TRIUMPH IN RETURNING AND NOT OF HIS MORE PROBABLE DISGRACE HE HAD ALLOWED OTHERS TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIM
5867-48852-0095 AND HAD SO MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT NOW ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS WERE OVER FOR HIM HOW COULD HE ESCAPE AT ONCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BACK TO LONDON HOW COULD HE GET AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD FURTHER TO ANY ONE
5867-48852-0096 HE CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE END OF THE SQUIRE'S PROPERTY WHERE THE PARISH OF ALLINGTON DIVIDES ITSELF FROM THAT OF ABBOT'S GUEST IN WHICH THE EARL'S HOUSE STANDS AND MADE HIS WAY BACK ALONG THE COPSE WHICH SKIRTED THE FIELD IN WHICH THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE BULL
5867-48852-0097 AH YES IT HAD BEEN WELL FOR HIM THAT HE HAD NOT COME OUT ON HORSEBACK THAT RIDE HOME ALONG THE HIGH ROAD AND UP TO THE MANOR HOUSE STABLES WOULD UNDER HIS PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM
5867-48852-0098 AS IT WAS HE DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS PLACE IN THE EARL'S HOUSE HOW COULD HE PRETEND TO MAINTAIN HIS ORDINARY DEMEANOUR UNDER THE EYES OF THOSE TWO OLD MEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GET HOME TO HIS MOTHER
5867-48852-0099 TO SEND A MESSAGE FROM THENCE TO THE MANOR AND THEN TO ESCAPE BACK TO LONDON SO THINKING BUT WITH NO RESOLUTION MADE HE WENT ON THROUGH THE WOODS
5867-48852-0100 THERE HE STOPPED AND STOOD A WHILE WITH HIS BROAD HAND SPREAD OVER THE LETTERS WHICH HE HAD CUT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS SO AS TO HIDE THEM FROM HIS SIGHT WHAT AN ASS I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS AND EVER HE SAID TO HIMSELF
5867-48852-0101 IT WAS NOT ONLY OF HIS LATE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HE WAS THINKING BUT OF HIS WHOLE PAST LIFE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS HOBBLEDEHOYHOOD
5867-48852-0102 OF THAT BACKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN ASSUMING MANHOOD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF MAKING HIMSELF ACCEPTABLE TO LILY BEFORE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CROSBIE
5867-48852-0103 IF SUCH SENDING MIGHT POSSIBLY BE DONE BY FAIR BEATING REGARDLESS WHETHER HE HIMSELF MIGHT BE CALLED UPON TO FOLLOW HIM WAS IT NOT HARD THAT FOR THE TWO OF THEM FOR LILY AND FOR HIM ALSO
5867-48852-0104 THERE SHOULD BE SUCH PUNISHMENT BECAUSE OF THE INSINCERITY OF THAT MAN WHEN HE HAD THUS STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH DEEP ROUGH GASHES IN THE WOOD CUT OUT LILY'S NAME FROM THE RAIL
5867-48852-0105 HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED AND WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE CHIPS AS THEY WERE BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM WHEN A GENTLE STEP CAME CLOSE UP TO HIM AND TURNING ROUND HE SAW THAT LADY JULIA WAS ON THE BRIDGE SHE WAS CLOSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0106 AND HAD ALREADY SEEN HIS HANDIWORK HAS SHE OFFENDED YOU JOHN SHE SAID
5867-48852-0107 DO YOU MEAN TO CUT IT OUT FROM YOUR HEART NEVER I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I NEVER SHALL KEEP TO IT AS TO A GREAT TREASURE IT WILL BE A JOY TO YOU IN AFTER YEARS AND NOT A SORROW
5867-48852-0108 WILL BE A CONSOLATION WHEN YOU ARE AS OLD AS I AM IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE HAD A HEART
5867-48852-0109 AND JOHN I CAN UNDERSTAND HER FEELING NOW AND INDEED I THOUGHT ALL THROUGH THAT YOU WERE ASKING HER TOO SOON BUT THE TIME MAY YET COME WHEN SHE WILL THINK BETTER OF YOUR WISHES NO NO NEVER I BEGIN TO KNOW HER NOW
5867-48852-0110 IF YOU CAN BE CONSTANT IN YOUR LOVE YOU MAY WIN HER YET REMEMBER HOW YOUNG SHE IS AND HOW YOUNG YOU BOTH ARE COME AGAIN IN TWO YEARS TIME AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE WON HER YOU SHALL TELL ME THAT I HAVE BEEN A GOOD OLD WOMAN TO YOU BOTH
5867-48852-0111 I SHALL NEVER WIN HER LADY JULIA AS HE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
5867-48852-0112 IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT SHE HAD COME UPON HIM IN HIS SORROW WHEN HE ONCE KNEW THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIS TEARS
