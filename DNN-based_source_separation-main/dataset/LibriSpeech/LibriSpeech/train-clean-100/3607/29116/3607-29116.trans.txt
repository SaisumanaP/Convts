3607-29116-0008 AND FOR THE GOOD OF THE COLORED RACE MUCH AS I AM INTERESTED IN THE HEIRS OF THIS PROPERTY AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM SUCCEED LAURA LOOKED A LITTLE INCREDULOUS AND THE SENATOR PROCEEDED DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME I DON'T DENY THAT IT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF ALL OF US THAT THIS BILL SHOULD GO THROUGH AND IT WILL
3607-29116-0009 I HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS FROM YOU BUT I HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GUIDE I NEVER PUSH A PRIVATE INTEREST IF IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED BY SOME LARGER PUBLIC GOOD

3607-29116-0012 THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD SAID THE SENATOR SMILING AND RUBBING HIS HANDS IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'LL FIND SOME CHANGES IN THAT I GUESS HANDING THE SENATOR A PRINTED LIST OF NAMES THOSE CHECKED OFF ARE ALL RIGHT AH M M
3607-29116-0013 RUNNING HIS EYE DOWN THE LIST THAT'S ENCOURAGING WHAT IS THE C BEFORE SOME OF THE NAMES AND THE B B THOSE ARE MY PRIVATE MARKS THAT C STANDS FOR CONVINCED WITH ARGUMENT
3607-29116-0014 I EXPECT TO SEE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE TO DAY MISTER BUCKSTONE
3607-29116-0015 BUT HE HAS CHARITABLE IMPULSES IF WE SECURE HIM WE SHALL HAVE A FAVORABLE REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE
3607-29116-0016 OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
3607-29116-0017 HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OBJECTIONS NOT EXACTLY HE SAID SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID ASKED LAURA GLANCING FURTIVELY AT HIM CERTAINLY HE SAID HE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A GOOD THING IF SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS IN IT IT WOULD PAY TO LOOK INTO IT
3607-29116-0018 THE SENATOR LAUGHED BUT RATHER FEEBLY AND SAID BALLOON IS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT HE ONLY WANTED A WORD WITH YOU CONTINUED LAURA HE IS A HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN AND HE IS GALLANT FOR AN OLD MAN
3607-29116-0019 MY DAUGHTER SAID THE SENATOR WITH A GRAVE LOOK I TRUST THERE WAS NOTHING FREE IN HIS MANNER FREE REPEATED LAURA WITH INDIGNATION IN HER FACE WITH ME THERE THERE CHILD I MEANT NOTHING BALLOON TALKS A LITTLE FREELY SOMETIMES WITH MEN
3607-29116-0020 BUT HE IS RIGHT AT HEART HIS TERM EXPIRES NEXT YEAR AND I FEAR WE SHALL LOSE HIM HE SEEMED TO BE PACKING THE DAY I WAS THERE HIS ROOMS WERE FULL OF DRY GOODS BOXES INTO WHICH HIS SERVANT WAS CROWDING ALL MANNER OF OLD CLOTHES AND STUFF
3607-29116-0021 I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
3607-29116-0022 IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
3607-29116-0023 ERASING FIGURING AND TALKING TO HERSELF FREE I WONDER WHAT DILWORTHY DOES THINK OF ME ANYWAY ONE TWO EIGHT SEVENTEEN
3607-29116-0024 WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON SON IN LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN
3607-29116-0025 SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
3607-29116-0026 UNCLE DILWORTHY UNCLE BALLOON TELLS VERY AMUSING STORIES WHEN LADIES ARE NOT PRESENT I SHOULD THINK SO M M EIGHTY FIVE THERE I MUST FIND THAT CHAIRMAN QUEER BUCKSTONE ACTS
3607-29116-0027 SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T STRANGE VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MISTER BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE
3607-29116-0028 BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MISTER BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR
3607-29116-0029 AND MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT PROPER TO TELL HIM SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY THIS TIME WITH A GOOD MANY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS OF NEWSPAPER ROW AND EXCHANGED GOSSIP WITH THEM TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE
3607-29116-0030 THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE COLONEL SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT
3607-29116-0031 AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
3607-29116-0032 AND THEN HICKS WENT ON WITH A SERIOUS AIR COLONEL IF YOU REGISTER A LETTER IT MEANS THAT IT IS OF VALUE DOESN'T IT AND IF YOU PAY FIFTEEN CENTS FOR REGISTERING IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE EXTRA CARE OF IT AND EVEN PAY YOU BACK ITS FULL VALUE IF IT IS LOST ISN'T THAT SO
3607-29116-0033 YES I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
3607-29116-0034 IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY
3607-29116-0035 NOW COLONEL CAN YOU PICTURE JEFFERSON OR WASHINGTON OR JOHN ADAMS FRANKING THEIR WARDROBES THROUGH THE MAILS AND ADDING THE FACETIOUS IDEA OF MAKING THE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARGO FOR THE SUM OF ONE DOLLAR AND FIVE CENTS STATESMEN WERE DULL CREATURES IN THOSE DAYS
3607-29116-0036 I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3607-29116-0038 YES AND BALLOON HAS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLIC EXPERIENCE HE IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HE WAS GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE TERRITORIES A WHILE AND WAS VERY SATISFACTORY INDEED HE WAS HE WAS EX OFFICIO INDIAN AGENT TOO
3607-29116-0039 WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
3607-29116-0040 THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
3607-29116-0041 WE HAVE MANY TRULY NOBLE STATESMEN IN OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE LIKE BALLOON THE SENATE IS FULL OF THEM DON'T YOU THINK SO COLONEL WELL I DUNNO I HONOR MY COUNTRY'S PUBLIC SERVANTS AS MUCH AS ANY ONE CAN I MEET THEM SIR EVERY DAY AND THE MORE I SEE OF THEM
3607-29116-0042 OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
3607-29116-0043 AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF
3607-29116-0044 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU COLONEL SELLERS WELL HESITATED THE COLONEL I AM AFRAID SOME OF THEM DO BUY THEIR SEATS YES I AM AFRAID THEY DO BUT AS SENATOR DILWORTHY HIMSELF SAID TO ME IT IS SINFUL IT IS VERY WRONG IT IS SHAMEFUL
3607-29116-0045 HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO TO BRIBERY IT IS A HARSH TERM I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT
