3214-167606-0027 SOME PEOPLE BEGAN TO LAUGH OTHERS CONTINUED TO WATCH IN DISMAY THE EXECUTIONER WHO WAS UNDRESSING THE OTHER MAN PIERRE CHOKED HIS FACE PUCKERED AND HE TURNED HASTILY AWAY WENT BACK TO HIS TRAP MUTTERING SOMETHING TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT AND TOOK HIS SEAT
3214-167606-0028 AS THEY DROVE ALONG HE SHUDDERED AND EXCLAIMED SEVERAL TIMES SO AUDIBLY THAT THE COACHMAN ASKED HIM WHAT IS YOUR PLEASURE WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHOUTED PIERRE TO THE MAN WHO WAS DRIVING TO LUBYANKA STREET
3214-167606-0029 AT THE SIGHT OF THE TORTURED FRENCHMAN AND THE CROWD SURROUNDING THE LOBNOE PLACE PIERRE HAD SO DEFINITELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD NO LONGER REMAIN IN MOSCOW AND WOULD LEAVE FOR THE ARMY THAT VERY DAY THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EITHER
3214-167606-0030 HE HAD TOLD THE COACHMAN THIS OR THAT THE MAN OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN IT FOR HIMSELF ON REACHING HOME PIERRE GAVE ORDERS TO EVSTAFEY HIS HEAD COACHMAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHING COULD DO ANYTHING AND WAS KNOWN TO ALL MOSCOW
3214-167606-0031 AND THAT HIS SADDLE HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY SO ON

3214-167606-0033 EVERY HOUSE IN MOZHAYSK HAD SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN IT AND AT THE HOSTEL WHERE PIERRE WAS MET BY HIS GROOM AND COACHMAN THERE WAS NO ROOM TO BE HAD IT WAS FULL OF OFFICERS
3214-167606-0034 EVERYWHERE IN MOZHAYSK AND BEYOND IT TROOPS WERE STATIONED OR ON THE MARCH COSSACKS FOOT AND HORSE SOLDIERS WAGONS CAISSONS AND CANNON WERE EVERYWHERE
3214-167606-0035 PIERRE PUSHED FORWARD AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE FARTHER HE LEFT MOSCOW BEHIND AND THE DEEPER HE PLUNGED INTO THAT SEA OF TROOPS THE MORE WAS HE OVERCOME BY RESTLESS AGITATION AND A NEW AND JOYFUL FEELING HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE
3214-167606-0036 THE COMFORTS OF LIFE WEALTH EVEN LIFE ITSELF IS RUBBISH IT IS PLEASANT TO THROW AWAY COMPARED WITH SOMETHING WITH WHAT PIERRE COULD NOT SAY AND HE DID NOT TRY TO DETERMINE FOR WHOM AND FOR WHAT HE FELT SUCH PARTICULAR DELIGHT IN SACRIFICING EVERYTHING
