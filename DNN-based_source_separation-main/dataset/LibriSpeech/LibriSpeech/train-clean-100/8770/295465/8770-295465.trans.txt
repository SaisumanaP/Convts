8770-295465-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN PATRIOT THERE WAS NO MORE STURDY LITTLE PATRIOT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAN LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN THE CHILD OF THE NATION
8770-295465-0001 NOR HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A MORE DEVOTED ADMIRER AND FOLLOWER THAN HIS OWN SMALL SON A WORD FROM HIS FATHER WOULD MELT THE LAD TO TEARS AND SUBMISSION OR BRING HIM OUT OF A NERVOUS TANTRUM WITH HIS
8770-295465-0002 WREATHED WITH SMILES AND A CHUCKLING IN HIS THROAT OF PAPA DAY MY PAPA DAY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE BOY MEANT BY PAPA DAY IT WAS HIS PET NAME FOR THE DEAREST MAN ON EARTH
8770-295465-0003 AND IT WAS HIS ONLY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GREATEST PLEASURE HIS BOYISH HEART WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT WAS THE SWEETEST WORD EVER HEARD BY THE WAR BURDENED CRUSHED AND SORROWING SOUL OF THE BROKEN HEARTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295465-0004 MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
8770-295465-0005 BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
8770-295465-0006 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0007 BUT THAT HIS HEART WENT OUT ALSO TO THE BOYS IN GRAY THE SOLDIERS WERE ALL BOYS TO HIM THEY KNEW HE LOVED THEM THEY SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE CARES FOR US HE TAKES OUR PART
8770-295465-0008 WE WILL FIGHT FOR HIM YES WE WILL DIE FOR HIM AND A LARGE PART OF THE COMMON SOLDIER'S PATRIOTISM WAS THIS HEART RESPONSE OF THE BOYS TO THE GREAT BOY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295465-0009 FOR THE YOUNGER SOLDIERS THE REAL BOYS OF THE ARMY GOING ALWAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIS PAPA DAY SAY OF SEVERAL YOUTHS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT FOR SLEEPING AT THEIR POST OR SOME LIKE OFFENSE
8770-295465-0010 THAT BOY IS WORTH MORE ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER OR A LIVE BOY CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER THAN A DEAD ONE GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S MOTTO
8770-295465-0011 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0012 BEGAN IN THE LOG CABIN WHEN HE HAD NO IDEA HE COULD EVER BE EXERCISING HIS LOVING KINDNESS IN THE EXECUTIVE MANSION THE HOME OF THE NATION WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL WAS THE RULE OF HIS LIFE
8770-295465-0013 IN THE BACKWOODS AS WELL AS IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND THE BOYS IN GRAY WERE HIS BOYS TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO THEY HAD WANDERED AWAY THEY WERE A LITTLE WAYWARD BUT HE WOULD WIN THEM BACK
8770-295465-0014 THE GREAT CHIVALROUS SOUTH HAS LEARNED SINCE THOSE BITTER RUINOUS DAYS THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE SOUTH THEN HAD IN THE NORTH TAD HAD SEEN HIS FATHER SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS TO ALL THE BOYS
8770-295465-0015 HE MET IN THE GRAY UNIFORM BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW HIS TENDERNESS TO THE SOUTH THOUGH THERE WAS A SECRET PIGEONHOLE IN HIS DESK STUFFED FULL OF THREATS OF ASSASSINATION HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF DEATH
8770-295465-0016 AND THE COUNTRY ANY GOOD BUT IT HURT HIM DEEP IN HIS HEART TO KNOW THAT SOME OF HIS BELOVED CHILDREN MISUNDERSTOOD HIM SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL HIM IT WAS NO ONE'S BULLET WHICH MADE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MARTYR
8770-295465-0017 ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD SHOWN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE WHICH WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS VERY LIFE IF IT COULD SAVE OR HELP OTHERS ALL THESE THINGS LITTLE TAD COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED
8770-295465-0018 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0019 MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
8770-295465-0020 TO HOLD THE CANDLE BY WHICH MISTER LINCOLN WAS TO READ HIS SPEECH LITTLE TAD WAS WITH HIS FATHER AS USUAL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAD FINISHED READING A PAGE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT HE LET IT FLUTTER DOWN LIKE A LEAF OR A BIG WHITE BUTTERFLY
8770-295465-0021 FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0022 IT SEEMED RIDICULOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ALLOW ANY CHILD TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT AND HAMPER HIM WHILE DELIVERING A GREAT ADDRESS WHICH WOULD WIELD A NATIONAL IF NOT WORLD WIDE INFLUENCE
8770-295465-0023 WE MEET THIS EVENING NOT IN SORROW BUT GLADNESS OF HEART THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG AND RICHMOND AND THE SURRENDER OF THE PRINCIPAL INSURGENT ARMY AT APPOMATTOX GIVE HOPE OF A RIGHTEOUS AND SPEEDY PEACE
8770-295465-0024 AND WILL BE DULY PROMULGATED GIVE US DIXIE BOYS THEN HE WENT ON OUTLINING A POLICY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE SOUTH SHOWING A SPIRIT FAR HIGHER
8770-295465-0025 AND MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT OF THE LISTENING CROWD ON CONCLUDING HIS ADDRESS AND BIDDING THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE GOOD NIGHT HE TURNED TO THE SERENADING BAND AND SHOUTED JOYOUSLY GIVE US DIXIE BOYS PLAY DIXIE
8770-295465-0026 WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
8770-295465-0027 AS MISTER LINCOLN CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR AFTER SPEAKING TO THE CROWD MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD BEEN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS LOOKING ON FROM WITHIN EXCLAIMED TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE SO CARELESS
8770-295465-0028 SOME ONE COULD EASILY HAVE SHOT YOU WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING THERE AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE THREATENING YOUR LIFE THE PRESIDENT SMILED AT HIS WIFE THROUGH A LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE PAIN AND SADNESS AND SHRUGGED HIS GREAT SHOULDERS
8770-295465-0029 BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
8770-295465-0030 AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM
8770-295465-0031 LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL SEEING THOMAS PENDEL THE FAITHFUL DOORKEEPER HE WAILED FROM HIS BREAKING HEART TOM PEN TOM PEN THEY HAVE KILLED PAPA DAY THEY HAVE KILLED MY PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0032 AND NOW HIS MOTHER WAS DESPERATELY ILL AND HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED TAD OF COURSE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY ANY ONE COULD BE SO CRUEL AND WICKED AS TO WISH TO MURDER HIS DARLING PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0033 WHO LOVED EVERY ONE SO HE WANDERED THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS ACHING WITH LONELINESS MURMURING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF PAPA DAY WHERE'S MY PAPA DAY I'M TIRED
8770-295465-0034 TIRED OF PLAYING ALONE I WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER PLEASE PAPA DAY COME BACK AND PLAY WITH YOUR LITTLE TAD YOUNG THOUGH HE WAS HE COULD NOT SLEEP LONG AT NIGHT
8770-295465-0035 HIS SENSE OF LONELINESS PENETRATED HIS DREAMS SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHUCKLE AND GURGLE IN AN ECSTACY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN RIDING ON HIS FATHER'S BACK ROMPING THROUGH THE STATELY ROOMS
8770-295465-0036 TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
8770-295465-0037 PAPA DAY'S HAPPY I'M GLAD SO GLAD SIGHED THE LITTLE BOY FOR PAPA DAY NEVER WAS HAPPY HERE THEN HE FELL INTO HIS FIRST SWEET SLEEP SINCE THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT
8770-295465-0038 GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE THE FOND HEARTED LITTLE FELLOW WENT ABROAD WITH HIS MOTHER A FEW YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY THAT BROKE BOTH THEIR LIVES BY A SURGICAL OPERATION AND BY STRUGGLING MANFULLY
8770-295465-0039 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8770-295465-0040 FOR THIS AS FOR ALL THE INEQUITIES THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PREPARED HIS SPIRIT HAD SHONE THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE AS IF IN LETTERS OF LIVING FIRE WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
