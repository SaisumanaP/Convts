2136-5147-0025 AND IT IS REALLY SUCH A PITY FOR SHE'S A VERY PRETTY CREATURE AND A CLEVER WOMAN COULD MAKE HER QUITE CHARMING
2136-5147-0026 EIGHT AND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR MORE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WELL YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT EVER SO MUCH NOW

2136-5147-0033 YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL

2136-5147-0036 SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
2136-5147-0038 THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE BOTH ENTERED MADAME HAD ROLLED HERSELF IN THE BLUE COVERLET AND WAS LYING ON THE BED WITH HER FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOW AND ENVELOPED IN THE COVERING PERHAPS SHE'S ASLEEP SAID LADY KNOLLYS
2136-5147-0039 GETTING ROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AND STOOPING OVER HER MADAME LAY STILL AS A MOUSE COUSIN MONICA SET DOWN HER TWO LITTLE VIALS ON THE TABLE AND STOOPING AGAIN OVER THE BED BEGAN VERY GENTLY WITH HER FINGERS TO LIFT THE COVERLET THAT COVERED HER FACE
2136-5147-0040 MADAME UTTERED A SLUMBERING MOAN AND TURNED MORE UPON HER FACE CLASPING THE COVERLET FASTER ABOUT HER MADAME IT IS MAUD AND LADY KNOLLYS WE HAVE COME TO RELIEVE YOUR EAR PRAY LET ME SEE IT
