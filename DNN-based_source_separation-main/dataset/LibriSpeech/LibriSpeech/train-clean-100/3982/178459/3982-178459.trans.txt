3982-178459-0040 THAT SHE KNEW HE HAD NOT MEANT TO HURT HER AND THAT SMILE OF HERS SO LAMENTABLE BUT SO FAITHFULLY FRIENDLY MISTED HIS OWN EYES FOR HIS SHAMEFACEDNESS LOWERED THEM NO MORE
3982-178459-0041 LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME SHE SAID YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS THEY ARE TOO HUMILIATING FOR ME AND YOU'RE TOO GENTLE TO SAY THEM TELL ME THOUGH ISN'T IT TRUE

3982-178459-0045 I DID TRY TO MAKE JIM WANT TO MARRY ME I DID AND SHE SANK DOWN INTO THE CHAIR WEEPING BITTERLY AGAIN BIBBS WAS AGONIZED MARY HE GROANED
3982-178459-0046 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD CRY LISTEN SHE SAID LISTEN TILL I GET THROUGH I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WE WERE POOR AND WE WEREN'T FITTED TO BE WE NEVER HAD BEEN AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
3982-178459-0047 WE'D BEEN ALMOST RICH THERE WAS PLENTY BUT MY FATHER WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH OF THE TOWN HE WANTED TO BE RICHER BUT INSTEAD WELL JUST ABOUT THE TIME YOUR FATHER FINISHED BUILDING NEXT DOOR
3982-178459-0048 WE FOUND WE HADN'T ANYTHING PEOPLE SAY THAT SOMETIMES MEANING THAT THEY HAVEN'T ANYTHING IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN KIND BUT WE REALLY HADN'T ANYTHING WE HADN'T ANYTHING AT ALL BIBBS
3982-178459-0049 YOU MIGHT WONDER WHY I DIDN'T
3982-178459-0050 AND I WONDER MYSELF WHY WHEN A FAMILY LOSES ITS MONEY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY THE DAUGHTERS OUGHT TO GO AND BE STENOGRAPHERS IT'S CURIOUS
3982-178459-0051 NO I'D BEEN RAISED TO BE EITHER MARRIED COMFORTABLY OR A WELL TO DO OLD MAID IF I CHOSE NOT TO MARRY THE POVERTY CAME ON SLOWLY BIBBS BUT AT LAST IT WAS ALL THERE
3982-178459-0052 AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A STENOGRAPHER I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE ANYTHING EXCEPT A WELL TO DO OLD MAID OR SOMEBODY'S WIFE AND I COULDN'T BE A WELL TO DO OLD MAID THEN BIBBS I DID WHAT I'D BEEN RAISED TO KNOW HOW TO DO
3982-178459-0053 I WENT OUT TO BE FASCINATING AND BE MARRIED I DID IT OPENLY AT LEAST AND WITH A KIND OF DECENT HONESTY I TOLD YOUR BROTHER I HAD MEANT TO FASCINATE HIM
3982-178459-0054 BUT I LET HIM THINK THAT PERHAPS I MEANT TO MARRY HIM I THINK I DID MEAN TO MARRY HIM I HAD NEVER CARED FOR ANYBODY AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THERE REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING MORE THAN A KIND OF EXCITED FONDNESS I CAN'T BE SURE
3982-178459-0055 BUT I THINK THAT THOUGH I DID MEAN TO MARRY HIM I NEVER SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BECAUSE THAT SORT OF A MARRIAGE IS IT'S SACRILEGE SOMETHING WOULD HAVE STOPPED ME
3982-178459-0056 SHE MEANT NO HARM BUT SHE WAS HORRIBLE AND SHE PUT WHAT I WAS DOING INTO SUCH HORRIBLE WORDS AND THEY WERE THE TRUTH OH I SAW MYSELF SHE WAS PROPOSING A MISERABLE COMPACT WITH ME
3982-178459-0057 AND I COULDN'T BREATHE THE AIR OF THE SAME ROOM WITH HER THOUGH I'D SO CHEAPENED MYSELF SHE HAD A RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT I WOULD BUT I COULDN'T I LEFT HER AND I WROTE TO YOUR BROTHER JUST A QUICK SCRAWL I TOLD HIM JUST WHAT I'D DONE
