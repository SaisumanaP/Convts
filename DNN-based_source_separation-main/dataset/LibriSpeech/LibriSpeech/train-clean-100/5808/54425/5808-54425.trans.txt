5808-54425-0000 FIVE YEARS IS BUT A SHORT TIME IN THE LIFE OF A MAN AND YET MANY THINGS MAY HAPPEN THEREIN FOR INSTANCE THE WHOLE WAY OF A FAMILY'S LIFE MAY BE CHANGED GOOD NATURES MAY BE MADE INTO BAD ONES
5808-54425-0001 AND OUT OF A SOUL OF FAITH GROW A SPIRIT OF UNBELIEF THE INDEPENDENCE OF RESPECTABILITY MAY HARDEN INTO THE INSOLENCE OF DEFIANCE AND THE SENSITIVE CHEEK OF MODESTY INTO THE BRAZEN FACE OF SHAMELESSNESS
5808-54425-0002 IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THE HABITS OF YEARS ARE HARD TO CHANGE BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE FIRST SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE ELSE KITTY HAMILTON AND JOE COULD NOT SO EASILY HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY WERE
5808-54425-0003 IT HAD TAKEN BARELY FIVE YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH AN ENTIRE METAMORPHOSIS OF THEIR CHARACTERS IN JOE'S CASE EVEN A SHORTER TIME WAS NEEDED HE WAS SO READY TO GO DOWN THAT IT NEEDED BUT A GENTLE PUSH TO START HIM AND ONCE STARTED
5808-54425-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN HIM TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM THE DEPTHS FOR HIS WILL WAS AS FLABBY AS HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS PRIDE WHICH STANDS TO SOME MEN FOR CONSCIENCE HAD NO DEFINITE AIM OR DIRECTION
5808-54425-0005 HATTIE STERLING HAD GIVEN HIM BOTH HIS GREATEST IMPULSE FOR EVIL AND FOR GOOD SHE HAD AT FIRST GIVEN HIM HIS GENTLE PUSH BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HIS COLLAPSE WOULD LOSE HER A FAITHFUL AND USEFUL SLAVE
5808-54425-0006 SHE HAD SOUGHT TO CHECK HIS COURSE HER THREAT OF THE SEVERANCE OF THEIR RELATIONS HAD HELD HIM UP FOR A LITTLE TIME AND SHE BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS SAFE AGAIN HE WENT BACK TO THE WORK HE HAD NEGLECTED DRANK MODERATELY
5808-54425-0007 AND ACTED IN MOST THINGS AS A SOUND SENSIBLE BEING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT DOWN BADLY SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND THREW HIM OVER
5808-54425-0008 THEN HE BECAME A HANGER ON AT THE CLUBS A GENTEEL LOAFER HE USED TO SAY IN HIS SOBER MOMENTS THAT AT LAST HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS THAT SADNESS HAD SPOKEN OF HE DID NOT WORK
5808-54425-0009 BUT HE SOON TIRED OF BEING SEPARATED FROM HATTIE AND STRAIGHTENED UP AGAIN AFTER SOME DEMUR SHE RECEIVED HIM UPON HIS FORMER FOOTING IT WAS ONLY FOR A FEW MONTHS HE FELL AGAIN FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS THIS HAD HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY
5808-54425-0010 FINALLY HE TOOK A TURN FOR THE BETTER THAT ENDURED SO LONG THAT HATTIE STERLING AGAIN GAVE HIM HER FAITH THEN THE WOMAN MADE HER MISTAKE SHE WARMED TO HIM SHE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE WAS PROUD OF HIM
5808-54425-0011 HE WENT FORTH AT ONCE TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HE DID NOT RETURN TO HER FOR THREE DAYS THEN HE WAS BATTERED UNKEMPT AND THICK OF SPEECH SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENT CONTEMPT FOR A WHILE AS HE SAT NURSING HIS ACHING HEAD
5808-54425-0012 SHE SAID FINALLY WITH CUTTING SCORN YOU OUGHT TO BE PUT UNDER A GLASS CASE AND PLACED ON EXHIBITION HE GROANED AND HIS HEAD SUNK LOWER A DRUNKEN MAN IS ALWAYS DISARMED
5808-54425-0013 HIS HELPLESSNESS INSTEAD OF INSPIRING HER WITH PITY INFLAMED HER WITH AN UNFEELING ANGER THAT BURST FORTH IN A VOLUME OF TAUNTS
5808-54425-0014 NO ONE HAD EVER LOOKED AT YOU UNTIL I PICKED YOU UP AND YOU VE BEEN STRUTTING AROUND EVER SINCE

5808-54425-0017 HE PLEADED STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TO HER HER EYES BLAZED BACK AT HIM BUT SHE SANG ON INSOLENTLY TAUNTINGLY THE VERY INANITY OF THE MAN DISGUSTED HER
5808-54425-0018 AND ON A SUDDEN IMPULSE SHE SPRANG UP AND STRUCK HIM FULL IN THE FACE WITH THE FLAT OF HER HAND HE WAS TOO WEAK TO RESIST THE BLOW AND TUMBLING FROM THE CHAIR FELL LIMPLY TO THE FLOOR WHERE HE LAY AT HER FEET
