1594-135914-0000 IN THIS MISERABLE STATE THEY CAME TO THE FIRST VILLAGE THE PEASANTS WIVES FLOCKED ABOUT THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE OF SOME CONDITION ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF THEIR TRAVELLING IN A HABIT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THEM
1594-135914-0001 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0003 JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER DEPARTED FROM THAT VILLAGE TAKING SHORT JOURNEYS TOWARDS ALEPPO THEY USED AT DUSK TO RETIRE NEAR OR INTO THE MOSQUES WHERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT ON THE MAT IF THERE WAS ANY
1594-135914-0004 OR ELSE ON THE BARE PAVEMENT AND SOMETIMES RESTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACES APPOINTED FOR THE USE OF TRAVELLERS AS FOR SUSTENANCE THEY DID NOT WANT FOR THEY OFTEN CAME TO PLACES WHERE BREAD BOILED RICE AND OTHER PROVISIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TRAVELLERS WHO DESIRE IT
1594-135914-0005 AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
1594-135914-0006 THENCE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEY HAD ENDURED THEY PROCEEDED TO BAGDAD THAT WAS THE PLACE THEY HAD FIXED THEIR THOUGHTS UPON
1594-135914-0007 BUT THEY HOPED BECAUSE THEY WISHED IT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM INCREASING INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING WITH THEIR MISFORTUNES THEIR CONVERSATION WAS GENERALLY ABOUT HIM AND THEY INQUIRED FOR HIM OF ALL THEY MET BUT LET US LEAVE JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER
1594-135914-0008 AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
1594-135914-0009 THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHOSE FATE WAS A KILLING AFFLICTION THERE WAS SCARCELY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE DID NOT LAMENT HIM
1594-135914-0010 AND SOMETIMES BY THOSE NIGHT WALKS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HIS COURT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE REACHED HIS EAR ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IN HIS WALK HE HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE DARK TOWER AND FANCYING HE HEARD SOMEBODY TALK
1594-135914-0011 STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME
1594-135914-0012 WHITHER HAS THY CRUEL FATE LED THEE ALAS IT IS I THAT HAVE MADE YOU WRETCHED WHY DID YOU NOT LET ME PERISH MISERABLY RATHER THAN AFFORD ME YOUR GENEROUS RELIEF WHAT MELANCHOLY RETURN HAVE YOU RECEIVED FOR YOUR CARE AND RESPECT
1594-135914-0013 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
1594-135914-0014 HOW CAN YOU EXCULPATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU SHALL APPEAR WITH GANEM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE AND THE ANGELS SHALL TESTIFY THE TRUTH BEFORE YOUR FACE ALL THE POWER YOU ARE NOW INVESTED WITH AND WHICH MAKES ALMOST THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLE
1594-135914-0015 WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
1594-135914-0016 HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS TRUE HIS FAVOURITE MUST BE INNOCENT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS AGAINST GANEM AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0017 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE RESPECTED FETNAH AND HAD BEEN MUCH CONCERNED AT HER DISGRACE THEREFORE FLYING INSTANTLY TO THE TOWER MADAM SAID HE TO THE FAVOURITE WITH SUCH AN AIR AS EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION BE PLEASED TO FOLLOW ME
1594-135914-0018 I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER MORE RETURN TO THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I DRAW FROM THIS A HAPPY OMEN
1594-135914-0019 SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND SO CONTINUED HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
1594-135914-0020 I THINK YOU CHARGE ME WITH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WHO IS HE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGARD AND RESPELL HE HAD FOR ME IS IN A MISERABLE CONDITION SPEAK FREELY
1594-135914-0021 YOU KNOW THE NATURAL GOODNESS OF MY DISPOSITION AND THAT I LOVE TO DO JUSTICE BY THESE WORDS
1594-135914-0022 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE IF I HAVE LET FALL ANY WORD THAT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY I MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT HE WHOSE INNOCENCE AND WRETCHED STATE YOU DESIRE TO BE INFORMED OF
1594-135914-0023 IS GANEM THE UNHAPPY SON OF ABOU AYOUB LATE A RICH MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS HE SAVED MY LIFE FROM A GRAVE AND AFFORDED ME A SANCTUARY IN HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0024 I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
1594-135914-0025 AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT
1594-135914-0026 I OWE THIS JUSTICE TO HIS VIRTUE TO DECLARE HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ALWAYS SUITABLE TO HIS WORDS YOU COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WELL KNOW WITH WHAT RIGOUR YOU HAVE TREATED HIM AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR IT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF GOD
1594-135914-0027 I MUST MAKE A CONFESSION WHICH PERHAPS MAY DISPLEASE YOU BUT I BEG PARDON OF YOUR MAJESTY BEFOREHAND SPEAK DAUGHTER SAID HAROON AL RUSHEED I FORGIVE YOU ALL PROVIDED YOU CONCEAL NOTHING FROM ME WELL THEN REPLIED FETNAH
1594-135914-0028 LET ME INFORM YOU THAT GANEM'S RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR JOINED TO ALL THE GOOD OFFICES HE DID ME GAINED HIM MY ESTEEM I WENT FURTHER YET YOU KNOW THE TYRANNY OF LOVE I FELT SOME TENDER INCLINATION RISING IN MY BREAST
1594-135914-0029 HE PERCEIVED IT BUT FAR FROM AVAILING HIMSELF OF MY FRAILTY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FLAME WHICH CONSUMED HIM HE STILL REMAINED STEADY IN HIS DUTY AND ALL THAT HIS PASSION COULD FORCE FROM HIM WERE THE WORDS I HAVE ALREADY REPEATED TO YOUR MAJESTY
1594-135914-0030 THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE THIS INGENUOUS CONFESSION
1594-135914-0031 AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION
1594-135914-0032 WHEN SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1594-135914-0033 I BELIEVE ALL YOU HAVE TOLD ME BUT WHY WAS IT SO LONG BEFORE YOU LET ME HEAR FROM YOU WAS THERE ANY NEED OF STAYING A WHOLE MONTH AFTER MY RETURN BEFORE YOU SENT ME WORD WHERE YOU WERE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED FETNAH
1594-135914-0034 GANEM WENT ABROAD SO VERY SELDOM THAT YOU NEED NOT WONDER WE WERE NOT THE FIRST THAT HEARD OF YOUR RETURN BESIDES GANEM WHO TOOK UPON HIM TO DELIVER THE LETTER I WROTE TO NOURON NIHAR
1594-135914-0035 WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING IT INTO HER OWN HANDS IT IS ENOUGH FETNAH
1594-135914-0036 I ACKNOWLEDGE MY FAULT AND WOULD WILLINGLY MAKE AMENDS FOR IT BY HEAPING FAVOURS ON THE YOUNG MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS CONSIDER THEREFORE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM ASK WHAT YOU THINK FIT AND I WILL GRANT IT
1594-135914-0037 AND RISING AGAIN SAID COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS AFTER RETURNING YOUR MAJESTY THANKS FOR GANEM I MOST HUMBLY ENTREAT YOU TO CAUSE IT TO BE PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT YOUR DO MINIONS THAT YOU PARDON THE SON OF ABOU AYOUB AND THAT HE MAY SAFELY COME TO YOU
1594-135914-0038 I MUST DO MORE REJOINED THE PRINCE IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING SAVED YOUR LIFE AND THE RESPECT HE HAS STREWN FOR ME TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE LOSS OF HIS FORTUNE IN SHORT TO REPAIR THE WRONG I HAVE DONE TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0039 I GIVE HIM TO YOU FOR A HUSBAND
1594-135914-0040 SHE THEN WITHDREW INTO THE APARTMENT SHE HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE HER MELANCHOLY ADVENTURE
1594-135914-0041 SHE SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AND THE THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD IN GIVING ALMS AT THE MOSQUES AND RETURNED TO THE PALACE IN THE EVENING
1594-135914-0042 THE NEXT DAY SHE TOOK ANOTHER PURSE OF THE SAME VALUE AND IN THE LIKE EQUIPAGE AS THE DAY BEFORE WENT TO THE SQUARE OF THE JEWELLERS SHOPS AND STOPPING AT THE GATEWAY WITHOUT ALIGHTING SENT ONE OF HER BLACK EUNUCHS FOR THE SYNDIC OR CHIEF OF THEM
1594-135914-0043 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MOST CHARITABLE MAN AND SPENT ABOVE TWO THIRDS OF HIS INCOME IN RELIEVING POOR STRANGERS SICK OR IN DISTRESS DID NOT MAKE FETNAH WAIT KNOWING BY HER DRESS THAT SHE WAS A LADY BELONGING TO THE PALACE I APPLY MYSELF TO YOU SAID SHE
1594-135914-0044 PUTTING THE PURSE INTO HIS HANDS AS A PERSON WHOSE PIETY IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY I DESIRE YOU TO DISTRIBUTE THAT GOLD AMONG THE POOR STRANGERS YOU RELIEVE FOR I KNOW YOU MAKE IT YOUR BUSINESS TO ASSIST THOSE WHO APPLY TO YOUR CHARITY
1594-135914-0045 I AM ALSO SATISFIED THAT YOU PREVENT THEIR WANTS AND THAT NOTHING IS MORE GRATEFUL TO YOU THAN TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF RELIEVING THEIR MISERY MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC I SHALL OBEY YOUR COMMANDS WITH PLEASURE BUT IF YOU DESIRE TO EXERCISE YOUR CHARITY IN PERSON
1594-135914-0046 AND WILL BE PLEASED TO STEP TO MY HOUSE
1594-135914-0047 I MET THEM YESTERDAY AS THEY WERE COMING INTO THE CITY THEY WERE IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND IT MOVED ME THE MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE PERSONS OF RANK THROUGH ALL THE RAGS THAT COVERED THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPRESSION THE SUN HAS MADE ON THEIR FACES
1594-135914-0048 WHILST SHE HERSELF LED THEM TO OUR WARM BATH AND GAVE THEM CLEAN LINEN
1594-135914-0049 BECAUSE WE WISH TO LET THEM TAKE SOME REST BEFORE WE TROUBLE THEM WITH OUR QUESTIONS FETNAH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FELT A CURIOSITY TO SEE THEM THE SYNDIC WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER TO HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0050 FOR THEY WERE THE PERSONS THE SYNDIC HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF TO FETNAH THE SYNDIC'S WIFE BEING INFORMED BY THE SLAVE THAT A LADY FROM THE PALACE WAS IN HER HOUSE WAS HASTENING TO MEET HER BUT FETNAH WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE SLAVE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME
1594-135914-0051 ON HER COMING INTO THE CHAMBER THE SYNDIC'S WIFE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HER
1594-135914-0052 FETNAH RAISED HER UP AND SAID MY GOOD LADY
1594-135914-0053 MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC'S WIFE THEY LIE IN THOSE BEDS YOU SEE BY EACH OTHER
1594-135914-0054 GOOD WOMAN SAID SHE I COME TO OFFER YOU MY ASSISTANCE I HAVE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CITY AND MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU AND YOUR COMPANION MADAM ANSWERED GANEM'S MOTHER
1594-135914-0055 THAT FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC'S WIFE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS
1594-135914-0056 SAID TO GANEM'S MOTHER BE SO KIND AS TO TELL US YOUR MISFORTUNES AND RECOUNT YOUR STORY YOU CANNOT MAKE THE RELATION TO ANY PERSONS BETTER DISPOSED TO USE ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO COMFORT YOU
1594-135914-0057 MADAM REPLIED ABOU AYOUB'S DISCONSOLATE WIDOW A FAVOURITE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS A LADY WHOSE NAME IS FETNAH IS THE OCCASION OF ALL OUR MISFORTUNES THESE WORDS WERE LIKE A THUNDERBOLT TO THE FAVOURITE
1594-135914-0058 BUT SUPPRESSING HER AGITATION AND CONCERN SHE SUFFERED GANEM'S MOTHER TO PROCEED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
1594-135914-0059 I HAD A SON CALLED GANEM WHO COMING TO TRADE AT BAGDAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CARRYING OFF FETNAH
1594-135914-0060 AND THEN TO BANISH US OUT OF SYRIA FOR EVER BUT HOW UNWORTHY SOEVER OUR USAGE HAS BEEN
1594-135914-0061 WHAT A PLEASURE WOULD IT BE FOR HIS SISTER AND ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN EMBRACING HIM WE SHOULD FORGET THE LOSS OF OUR PROPERTY AND ALL THE EVILS WE HAVE SUFFERED ON HIS ACCOUNT ALAS
1594-135914-0062 NO DOUBT OF IT SAID FETNAH INTERRUPTING HER THERE HE IS NO MORE GUILTY THAN YOU ARE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF HIS INNOCENCE FOR I AM THAT VERY FETNAH YOU SO MUCH COMPLAIN OF WHO THROUGH SOME FATALITY IN MY STARS
1594-135914-0063 HAVE OCCASIONED YOU SO MANY MISFORTUNES TO ME YOU MUST IMPUTE THE LOSS OF YOUR SON IF HE IS NO MORE BUT IF I HAVE OCCASIONED YOUR MISFORTUNE I CAN IN SOME MEASURE RELIEVE IT
1594-135914-0064 AND DOUBT NOT HE WILL DO YOU AS MUCH GOOD AS HE HAS DONE YOU INJURY YOU ARE NO LONGER HIS ENEMIES HE WAITS FOR GANEM TO REQUITE THE SERVICE HE HAS DONE ME BY UNITING OUR FORTUNES HE GIVES ME TO HIM FOR HIS CONSORT
1594-135914-0065 THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
1594-135914-0066 FETNAH HELD HER LONG IN HER ARMS AND ONLY LEFT HER TO EMBRACE THE DAUGHTER WHO SITTING UP
1594-135914-0067 THE WEALTH GANEM HAD IN THIS CITY IS NOT LOST IT IS IN MY APARTMENT IN THE PALACE BUT I KNOW ALL THE TREASURE OF THE WORLD CANNOT COMFORT YOU WITHOUT GANEM IF I MAY JUDGE OF YOU BY MYSELF BLOOD IS NO LESS POWERFUL THAN LOVE IN GREAT MINDS
1594-135914-0068 BUT WHY SHOULD WE DESPAIR OF SEEING HIM AGAIN WE SHALL FIND HIM THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING WITH YOU MAKES ME CONCEIVE FRESH HOPES PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SUFFERINGS AND THE BEGINNING OF A GREATER FELICITY THAN YOU ENJOYED IN DAMASCUS
1594-135914-0069 WHEN GANEM WAS WITH YOU FETNAH WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED BUT THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS COMING IN INTERRUPTED HER MADAM SAID HE TO HER I COME FROM SEEING A VERY MOVING OBJECT IT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOM A CAMEL DRIVER HAD JUST CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL
1594-135914-0070 HE WAS BOUND WITH CORDS ON A CAMEL BECAUSE HE HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO SIT THEY HAD ALREADY UNBOUND HIM AND WERE CARRYING HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL WHEN I HAPPENED TO PASS BY I WENT UP TO THE YOUNG MAN VIEWED HIM ATTENTIVELY
1594-135914-0071 AND FANCIED HIS COUNTENANCE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN TO ME I ASKED HIM SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND HIS COUNTRY BUT ALL THE ANSWERS I COULD GET WERE SIGHS AND TEARS I TOOK PITY ON HIM
1594-135914-0072 PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR CARE TAKEN OF HIM I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WAY OF MANAGING THE SICK AND AM SENSIBLE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE PHYSICIANS
1594-135914-0073 I HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BE BROUGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE BY MY SLAVES AND THEY ARE NOW IN A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE I PLACED HIM PUTTING ON SOME OF MY OWN LINEN AND TREATING HIM AS THEY WOULD DO MYSELF FETNAH'S HEART BEAT AT THESE WORDS OF THE JEWELLER
1594-135914-0074 AND SHE FELT A SUDDEN EMOTION FOR WHICH SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT SHEW ME SAID SHE TO THE SYNDIC INTO THE SICK MAN'S ROOM I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM THE SYNDIC CONDUCTED HER AND WHILST SHE WAS GOING THITHER
1594-135914-0075 WHOSE EYES WERE CLOSED HIS COUNTENANCE PALE DISFIGURED AND BATHED IN TEARS SHE GAZED EARNESTLY ON HIM HER HEART BEAT AND SHE FANCIED SHE BEHELD GANEM BUT YET SHE WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER EYES
1594-135914-0076 THOUGH SHE FOUND SOMETHING OF GANEM IN THE OBJETS SHE BEHELD YET IN OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARED SO DIFFERENT THAT SHE DURST NOT IMAGINE IT WAS HE THAT LAY BEFORE HER UNABLE HOWEVER TO WITHSTAND THE EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING SATISFIED
1594-135914-0077 GANEM SAID SHE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE IS IT YOU I BEHOLD HAVING SPOKEN THESE WORDS SHE STOPPED TO GIVE THE YOUNG MAN TIME TO ANSWER BUT OBSERVING THAT HE SEEMED INSENSIBLE ALAS GANEM ADDED SHE
1594-135914-0078 IT IS NOT YOU THAT I ADDRESS MY IMAGINATION BEING OVERCHARGED WITH YOUR IMAGE HAS GIVEN TO A STRANGER A DECEITFUL RESEMBLANCE
1594-135914-0079 HOWEVER INDISPOSED WOULD KNOW THE VOICE OF FETNAH AT THE NAME OF FETNAH GANEM FOR IT WAS REALLY HE
1594-135914-0080 AH MADAM SAID HE BY WHAT MIRACLE HE COULD SAY NO MORE SUCH A SUDDEN TRANSPORT OF JOY SEIZED HIM THAT HE FAINTED AWAY FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC DID ALL THEY COULD TO BRING HIM TO HIMSELF
1594-135914-0081 BUT AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED HE BEGAN TO REVIVE THE SYNDIC DESIRED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW LEST THE SIGHT OF HER SHOULD HEIGHTEN HIS DISORDER THE YOUNG MAN HAVING RECOVERED LOOKED ALL AROUND AND NOT SEEING WHAT HE SOUGHT EXCLAIMED
1594-135914-0082 WHAT IS BECOME OF YOU CHARMING FETNAH DID YOU REALLY APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES OR WAS IT ONLY AN ILLUSION NO SIR SAID THE SYNDIC IT WAS NO ILLUSION IT WAS I THAT CAUSED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW
1594-135914-0083 BUT YOU SHALL SEE HER AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO BEAR THE INTERVIEW YOU NOW STAND IN NEED OF REST AND NOTHING OUGHT TO OBSTRUCT YOUR TAKING IT THE SITUATION OF YOUR AFFAIRS IS ALTERED SINCE YOU ARE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GANEM
1594-135914-0084 IN FAVOUR OF WHOM THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS HAS CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE MADE IN BAGDAD DECLARING THAT HE FORGIVES HIM WHAT IS PASSED BE SATISFIED FOR THE PRESENT WITH KNOWING SO MUCH
1594-135914-0085 THE LADY WHO JUST NOW SPOKE TO YOU WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REST THEREFORE THINK OF NOTHING BUT RECOVERING YOUR HEALTH I WILL CONTRIBUTE ALL IN MY POWER TOWARDS IT HAVING SPOKE THESE WORDS HE LEFT GANEM TO TAKE HIS REST
1594-135914-0086 EXHAUSTED BY HARD LIVING AND TOIL
1594-135914-0087 THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THE SYNDIC'S SAYING ANY MORE TO GANEM'S MOTHER AS SOON AS SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT CONVERSE WITH HER SON WITHOUT HAZARDING HIS LIFE SHE CEASED INSISTING TO GO AND SEE HIM
1594-135914-0088 FETNAH THEN SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN FOR HAVING BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER
1594-135914-0089 AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
1594-135914-0090 WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY GRANTED AND BEING BROUGHT INTO THE PRINCE'S CLOSET WHERE HE WAS ALONE SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF AT HIS FEET WITH HER FACE ON THE GROUND ACCORDING TO CUSTOM HE COMMANDED HER TO RISE AND HAVING MADE HER SIT DOWN ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD HEARD ANY NEWS OF GANEM
1594-135914-0091 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE I HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM AND ALSO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
1594-135914-0092 AND SHE SATISFIED HIS INQUIRIES SAYING SO MANY THINGS IN COMMENDATION OF GANEM'S MOTHER AND SISTER HE DESIRED TO SEE THEM AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MERCHANT THOUGH HAROON AL RUSHEED WAS PASSIONATE AND IN HIS HEAT SOMETIMES GUILTY OF CRUEL ACTIONS
1594-135914-0093 HAVING THEREFORE NO LONGER CAUSE TO DOUBT BUT THAT HE HAD UNJUSTLY PERSECUTED GANEM AND HIS FAMILY AND HAD PUBLICLY WRONGED THEM HE RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC SATISFACTION
1594-135914-0094 THAT YOUR SEARCH HAS PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS A REAL SATISFACTION TO ME NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MY OWN I WILL KEEP THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE YOU YOU SHALL MARRY GANEM AND I HERE DECLARE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SLAVE YOU ARE FREE
1594-135914-0095 GO BACK TO THAT YOUNG MERCHANT AND AS SOON AS HE HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH YOU SHALL BRING HIM TO ME WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE NEXT MORNING EARLY FETNAH REPAIRED TO THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS BEING IMPATIENT TO HEAR OF GANEM'S HEALTH AND TELL THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD FOR THEM
1594-135914-0096 WHO TOLD HER THAT GANEM HAD RESTED WELL THAT NIGHT AND THAT HIS DISORDER PROCEEDING ALTOGETHER FROM MELANCHOLY THE CAUSE BEING REMOVED HE WOULD SOON RECOVER HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0097 REST AND THE GOOD MEDICINES HE HAD TAKEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION OF HIS MIND HAD WROUGHT SO GOOD AN EFFECT THAT THE SYNDIC THOUGHT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DANGER SEE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS MISTRESS PROVIDED HE WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM
1594-135914-0098 BECAUSE THERE WAS GROUND TO FEAR THAT NOT KNOWING HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE AT BAGDAD THE SIGHT OF THEM MIGHT OCCASION TOO GREAT SURPRISE AND JOY IT WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT FETNAH SHOULD FIRST GO ALONE INTO GANEM'S CHAMBER
1594-135914-0099 WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS PROPER MATTERS BEING SO ORDERED THE SYNDIC ANNOUNCED FETNAH'S COMING TO THE SICK MAN WHO WAS SO TRANSPORTED TO SEE HER THAT HE WAS AGAIN NEAR FAINTING AWAY WELL GANEM SAID SHE DRAWING NEAR TO HIS BED
1594-135914-0100 YOU HAVE AGAIN FOUND YOUR FETNAH WHOM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST FOR EVER
1594-135914-0101 WHAT MIRACLE HAS RESTORED YOU TO MY SIGHT
1594-135914-0102 HE HAS DOUBTLESS LISTENED TO YOU YOU HAVE DISPELLED HIS JEALOUSY AND HE HAS RESTORED YOU TO HIS FAVOUR YES MY DEAR GANEM ANSWERED FETNAH I HAVE CLEARED MYSELF BEFORE THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WHO TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE YOU
1594-135914-0103 BEAUTIFUL FETNAH MAY I GIVE CREDIT TO WHAT YOU TELL ME
1594-135914-0104 NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN ANSWERED THE LADY
1594-135914-0105 WHO BEFORE CAUSED SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR YOU TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LIFE AND WHO IN HIS FURY CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER TO SUFFER A THOUSAND INDIGNITIES DESIRES NOW TO SEE YOU THAT HE MAY REWARD THE RESPECT YOU HAD FOR HIM
1594-135914-0106 AND THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HE WILL LOAD YOUR FAMILY WITH FAVOURS
1594-135914-0107 AND HE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS AT THE RELATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE THOUGHTS WHICH AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING MARRIED TO HIS MISTRESS BUT WHEN FETNAH INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN BAGDAD AND IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM
1594-135914-0108 HE APPEARED SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM THAT THE FAVOURITE COULD NO LONGER DEFER GIVING HIM THE SATISFACTION AND ACCORDINGLY CALLED THEM IN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THEY ENTERED WENT UP TO GANEM AND EMBRACING HIM IN THEIR TURNS
1594-135914-0109 THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
1594-135914-0110 WHEN THEY HAD DRIED UP THEIR TEARS GANEM DREW THEM AFRESH BY THE RECITAL OF WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THE DAY HE LEFT FETNAH TILL THE MOMENT THE SYNDIC BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE HE TOLD THEM THAT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A SMALL VILLAGE HE THERE FELL SICK
1594-135914-0111 THAT SOME CHARITABLE PEASANTS HAD TAKEN CARE OF HIM BUT FINDING HE DID NOT RECOVER A CAMEL DRIVER HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CARRY HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AT BAGDAD
1594-135914-0112 AND HOW SHE HAD CLEARED HERSELF IN CONCLUSION WHEN THEY HAD RELATED WHAT ACCIDENTS HAD BEFALLEN THEM FETNAH SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND LET US THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE HAPPINESS THAT AWAITS US
1594-135914-0113 AS SOON AS GANEM HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0114 BUT I WILL GO AND MAKE SOME PROVISION FOR THEM THIS SAID SHE WENT TO THE PALACE AND SOON RETURNED WITH A PURSE CONTAINING A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO THE SYNDIC DESIRING HIM TO BUY APPAREL FOR THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

1594-135914-0119 WHICH HE MANAGED VERY GRACEFULLY THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BELONGING TO THE PALACE AND WHILST FETNAH ON ANOTHER MULE LED THEM BY A BYE WAY TO THE PRINCE'S COURT JAAFFIER CONDUCTED GANEM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE
1594-135914-0120 ARABS PERSIANS EGYPTIANS AFRICANS AND SYRIANS OF HIS OWN DOMINIONS NOT TO MENTION STRANGERS WHEN THE VIZIER HAD CONDUCTED GANEM TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE
1594-135914-0121 I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
1594-135914-0122 AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO HIM GANEM I WILL HAVE YOU LIVE IN MY COURT COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MERCHANT A SLAVE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS MASTER'S ON WHOM HIS LIFE AND FORTUNE DEPEND
