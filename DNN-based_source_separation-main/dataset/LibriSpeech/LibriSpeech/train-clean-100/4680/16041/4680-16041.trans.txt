4680-16041-0000 THESE MELANCHOLY OPENINGS WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE GLOOM BEFORE DESPAIR ARE TEMPTING MARIUS THRUST ASIDE THE BAR WHICH HAD SO OFTEN ALLOWED HIM TO PASS EMERGED FROM THE GARDEN AND SAID I WILL GO
4680-16041-0001 MAD WITH GRIEF NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING FIXED OR SOLID IN HIS BRAIN INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ANYTHING THENCEFORTH OF FATE AFTER THOSE TWO MONTHS PASSED IN THE INTOXICATION OF YOUTH AND LOVE
4680-16041-0002 OVERWHELMED AT ONCE BY ALL THE REVERIES OF DESPAIR HE HAD BUT ONE DESIRE REMAINING TO MAKE A SPEEDY END OF ALL HE SET OUT AT RAPID PACE HE FOUND HIMSELF MOST OPPORTUNELY ARMED
4680-16041-0003 BY THE BOULEVARD TRAVERSED THE ESPLANADE AND THE BRIDGE OF THE INVALIDES
4680-16041-0004 AND REACHED THE RUE DE RIVOLI THE SHOPS WERE OPEN THERE
4680-16041-0005 WOMEN WERE MAKING THEIR PURCHASES IN THE STALLS PEOPLE WERE EATING ICES IN THE CAFE LAITER AND NIBBLING SMALL CAKES AT THE ENGLISH PASTRY COOK'S SHOP
4680-16041-0006 AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CROWD INCREASED IN DENSITY FOR THE PASSERS BY NOW AMOUNTED TO A CROWD NO ONE COULD BE SEEN TO SPEAK IN THIS THRONG AND YET THERE AROSE FROM IT A DULL DEEP MURMUR
4680-16041-0007 NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ARBRE SEC THERE WERE ASSEMBLAGES MOTIONLESS AND GLOOMY GROUPS WHICH WERE TO THOSE WHO WENT AND CAME AS STONES IN THE MIDST OF RUNNING WATER AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
4680-16041-0008 THERE WERE HARDLY ANY BLACK COATS OR ROUND HATS NOW BUT SMOCK FROCKS BLOUSES CAPS AND BRISTLING AND CADAVEROUS HEADS THIS MULTITUDE UNDULATED CONFUSEDLY IN THE NOCTURNAL GLOOM
4680-16041-0009 ITS WHISPERINGS HAD THE HOARSE ACCENT OF A VIBRATION ALTHOUGH NOT ONE OF THEM WAS WALKING A DULL TRAMPLING WAS AUDIBLE IN THE MIRE BEYOND THIS DENSE PORTION OF THE THRONG IN THE RUE DU ROULE IN THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
4680-16041-0010 ONLY THE SOLITARY AND DIMINISHING ROWS OF LANTERNS COULD BE SEEN VANISHING INTO THE STREET IN THE DISTANCE THE LANTERNS OF THAT DATE RESEMBLED LARGE RED STARS HANGING TO ROPES AND SHED UPON THE PAVEMENT A SHADOW
4680-16041-0011 WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A HUGE SPIDER THESE STREETS WERE NOT DESERTED THERE COULD BE DESCRIED PILES OF GUNS MOVING BAYONETS AND TROOPS BIVOUACKING NO CURIOUS OBSERVER PASSED THAT LIMIT THERE CIRCULATION CEASED
4680-16041-0012 THERE THE RABBLE ENDED AND THE ARMY BEGAN MARIUS WILLED WITH THE WILL OF A MAN WHO HOPES NO MORE HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED HE MUST GO HE FOUND A MEANS TO TRAVERSE THE THRONG
4680-16041-0013 HE SHUNNED THE PATROLS HE AVOIDED THE SENTINELS HE MADE A CIRCUIT REACHED THE RUE DE BETHISY
4680-16041-0014 THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY LANTERNS AFTER HAVING PASSED THE ZONE OF THE CROWD HE HAD PASSED THE LIMITS OF THE TROOPS HE FOUND HIMSELF IN SOMETHING STARTLING THERE WAS NO LONGER A PASSER BY NO LONGER A SOLDIER
4680-16041-0015 NO LONGER A LIGHT THERE WAS NO ONE SOLITUDE SILENCE NIGHT
4680-16041-0016 ENTERING A STREET WAS LIKE ENTERING A CELLAR HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HE TOOK A FEW STEPS SOME ONE PASSED CLOSE TO HIM AT A RUN WAS IT A MAN OR A WOMAN WERE THERE MANY OF THEM HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
4680-16041-0017 IT HAD PASSED AND VANISHED PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET
4680-16041-0018 IT WAS AN OVERTURNED WAGON HIS FOOT RECOGNIZED POOLS OF WATER GULLIES AND PAVING STONES SCATTERED AND PILED UP
4680-16041-0019 HE CLIMBED OVER THE STONES AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER HE WALKED VERY NEAR THE STREET POSTS AND GUIDED HIMSELF ALONG THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE IT SEEMED TO HIM
4680-16041-0020 MARIUS LEFT THE HORSES BEHIND HIM AS HE WAS APPROACHING A STREET WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THE RUE DU CONTRAT SOCIAL A SHOT COMING NO ONE KNOWS WHENCE AND TRAVERSING THE DARKNESS AT RANDOM WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIM
4680-16041-0021 THE WHOLE OF THIS ITINERARY
4680-16041-0022 WHICH IS LIKE A CITY WITHIN A CITY
4680-16041-0023 HOLLOWED OUT IN THE CENTRE OF PARIS THERE THE GLANCE FELL INTO AN ABYSS THANKS TO THE BROKEN LANTERNS THANKS TO THE CLOSED WINDOWS THERE ALL RADIANCE ALL LIFE ALL SOUND ALL MOVEMENT CEASED
4680-16041-0024 THE INVISIBLE POLICE OF THE INSURRECTION WERE ON THE WATCH EVERYWHERE AND MAINTAINED ORDER THAT IS TO SAY NIGHT THE NECESSARY TACTICS OF INSURRECTION ARE TO DROWN SMALL NUMBERS IN A VAST OBSCURITY
4680-16041-0025 TO MULTIPLY EVERY COMBATANT BY THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH THAT OBSCURITY CONTAINS AT DUSK EVERY WINDOW WHERE A CANDLE WAS BURNING RECEIVED A SHOT THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED SOMETIMES THE INHABITANT WAS KILLED HENCE
4680-16041-0026 NOTHING WAS STIRRING THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FRIGHT MOURNING STUPOR IN THE HOUSES AND IN THE STREETS A SORT OF SACRED HORROR NOT EVEN THE LONG ROWS OF WINDOWS AND STORES THE INDENTATIONS OF THE CHIMNEYS AND THE ROOFS
4680-16041-0027 AND THE VAGUE REFLECTIONS WHICH ARE CAST BACK BY THE WET AND MUDDY PAVEMENTS WERE VISIBLE AN EYE CAST UPWARD AT THAT MASS OF SHADOWS MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE HERE AND THERE AT INTERVALS
4680-16041-0028 OF INDISTINCT GLEAMS WHICH BROUGHT OUT BROKEN AND ECCENTRIC LINES AND PROFILES OF SINGULAR BUILDINGS SOMETHING LIKE THE LIGHTS WHICH GO AND COME IN RUINS IT WAS AT SUCH POINTS THAT THE BARRICADES WERE SITUATED
4680-16041-0029 THE REST WAS A LAKE OF OBSCURITY FOGGY HEAVY AND FUNEREAL ABOVE WHICH IN MOTIONLESS AND MELANCHOLY OUTLINES ROSE THE TOWER OF SAINT JACQUES
4680-16041-0030 AND WHERE A FEW STREET LANTERNS STILL BURNED THE AERIAL OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE DISTINGUISHED THE METALLIC GLEAM OF SWORDS AND BAYONETS THE DULL RUMBLE OF ARTILLERY AND THE SWARMING OF SILENT BATTALIONS WHOSE RANKS WERE SWELLING FROM MINUTE TO MINUTE
4680-16041-0031 AND AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT DARKNESS A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE
4680-16041-0032 ALL WAS OVER NO MORE LIGHT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR HENCEFORTH EXCEPT THE LIGHTNING OF GUNS NO FURTHER ENCOUNTER EXCEPT THE ABRUPT AND RAPID APPARITION OF DEATH WHERE HOW WHEN NO ONE KNEW
4680-16041-0033 BUT IT WAS CERTAIN AND INEVITABLE IN THIS PLACE WHICH HAD BEEN MARKED OUT FOR THE STRUGGLE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURRECTION THE NATIONAL GUARD AND POPULAR SOCIETIES THE BOURGEOIS AND THE UPRISING GROPING THEIR WAY
4680-16041-0034 THAT THE MOST TIMID FELT THEMSELVES SEIZED WITH RESOLUTION AND THE MOST DARING WITH TERROR MOREOVER ON BOTH SIDES THE FURY THE RAGE AND THE DETERMINATION WERE EQUAL
4680-16041-0035 FOR THE ONE PARTY TO ADVANCE MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF RETREATING FOR THE OTHER TO REMAIN MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF FLIGHT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT ALL SHOULD BE ENDED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
4680-16041-0036 THAT TRIUMPH SHOULD REST EITHER HERE OR THERE THAT THE INSURRECTION SHOULD PROVE ITSELF A REVOLUTION OR A SKIRMISH THE GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THIS AS WELL AS THE PARTIES THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT BOURGEOIS FELT IT
4680-16041-0037 HERE ONLY ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE A SOUND AS HEART RENDING AS THE DEATH RATTLE
4680-16041-0038 NATURE SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN INTO ACCORD WITH WHAT MEN WERE ABOUT TO DO NOTHING DISTURBED THE HARMONY OF THE WHOLE EFFECT THE STARS HAD DISAPPEARED HEAVY CLOUDS FILLED THE HORIZON WITH THEIR MELANCHOLY FOLDS
4680-16041-0039 WHICH HAD ALREADY WITNESSED SO MANY REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS WHILE YOUTH THE SECRET ASSOCIATIONS THE SCHOOLS IN THE NAME OF PRINCIPLES AND THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN THE NAME OF INTERESTS
4680-16041-0040 CLASPING AND THROWING EACH OTHER WHILE EACH ONE HASTENED AND INVITED THE LAST AND DECISIVE HOUR OF THE CRISIS FAR AWAY AND QUITE OUTSIDE OF THIS FATAL QUARTER IN THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES OF THAT
4680-16041-0041 WRETCHED OLD PARIS WHICH DISAPPEARS UNDER THE SPLENDOR OF HAPPY AND OPULENT PARIS THE SOMBRE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE COULD BE HEARD GIVING UTTERANCE TO A DULL ROAR A FEARFUL AND SACRED VOICE
