2289-152258-0000 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ASIA AND AFRICA AND MUCH OF THOSE IN TURKEY IN EUROPE PROFESS THE MO HAM'ME DAN RELIGION THEY ARE CALLED MOHAMMEDANS MUS'SUL MANS OR MOSLEMS
2289-152258-0001 AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
2289-152258-0002 A CITY OF ARABIA HIS PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE THOUGH IT IS SAID THEY WERE DESCENDED FROM ARABIAN PRINCES THEY DIED WHEN MOHAMMED WAS A CHILD
2289-152258-0003 AND BROUGHT HIM UP WHEN THE BOY GREW OLD ENOUGH HE TOOK CARE OF HIS UNCLE'S SHEEP AND CAMELS SOMETIMES HE WENT ON JOURNEYS WITH HIS UNCLE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ARABIA TO HELP HIM IN HIS BUSINESS AS A TRADER ON THESE JOURNEYS MOHAMMED USED TO RIDE ON A CAMEL
2289-152258-0004 AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
2289-152258-0005 THAT PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE NAME OF EL AMIN WHICH MEANS THE TRUTHFUL AT THIS TIME HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT THE RICH TRADERS HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM THAT THEY GAVE HIM IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AND TRUSTED HIM WITH LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
2289-152258-0006 AND SOLD THERE THE GOODS CARRIED BY THE CAMELS
2289-152258-0007 AND FAITHFULLY PAID OVER TO THE OWNERS OF THE GOODS THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED MOHAMMED HAD NO SCHOOL EDUCATION HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE BUT HE WAS NOT IGNORANT HE KNEW WELL HOW TO DO THE WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM AND
2289-152258-0008 THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
2289-152258-0009 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF KHADIJAH FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED IN SO IMPORTANT A SERVICE
2289-152258-0010 SHE SAID I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOU AMONG THE TRADERS
2289-152258-0011 ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE CHARGE OF MY CARAVANS AND GIVE YOUR WHOLE TIME AND SERVICE TO ME MOHAMMED WAS DELIGHTED
2289-152258-0012 KHADIJAH THEN ENGAGED HIM AS THE MANAGER OF HER BUSINESS AND HE SERVED HER WELL AND FAITHFULLY SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIM
2289-152258-0013 AND SOON THEY CAME TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WERE MARRIED AS HE WAS NOW THE HUSBAND OF A RICH WOMAN HE DID NOT NEED TO WORK VERY HARD HE STILL CONTINUED TO ATTEND TO HIS WIFE'S BUSINESS BUT HE DID NOT MAKE SO MANY JOURNEYS AS BEFORE
2289-152258-0014 AND CHRISTIANITY BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER OF THEM
2289-152258-0015 WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
2289-152258-0016 IN A CAVE ON MOUNT HIRA NEAR MECCA HE SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS EVERY YEAR IN PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS MEDITATION HE DECLARED THAT WHILE PRAYING IN HIS CAVE HE OFTEN HAD VISIONS OF GOD AND HEAVEN
2289-152258-0017 HE SAID THAT MANY TIMES THE ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO HIM AND REVEALED TO HIM THE RELIGION WHICH HE AFTERWARDS TAUGHT HIS FOLLOWERS AS HE HIMSELF COULD NOT WRITE HE COMMITTED TO MEMORY ALL THAT THE ANGEL TOLD HIM AND HAD IT WRITTEN IN A BOOK
2289-152258-0018 THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE KORAN WHICH MEANS LIKE OUR OWN WORD BIBLE THE BOOK
2289-152258-0019 THREE WHEN MOHAMMED RETURNED HOME AFTER THE ANGEL HAD FIRST SPOKEN TO HIM HE TOLD HIS WIFE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD SHE AT ONCE BELIEVED AND SO BECAME A CONVERT TO THE NEW RELIGION
2289-152258-0020 SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AT THE FEET OF HER HUSBAND AND CRIED OUT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD MOHAMMED IS GOD'S PROPHET MOHAMMED THEN TOLD THE STORY TO OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY SOME OF THEM BELIEVED AND BECAME HIS FIRST FOLLOWERS
2289-152258-0021 SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
2289-152258-0022 LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
2289-152258-0023 HE WENT ON TELLING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF GABRIEL AND PREACHING THE DOCTRINES WHICH HE SAID THE ANGEL HAD ORDERED HIM TO TEACH THE PEOPLE
2289-152258-0024 AT SUCH TIMES HIS FACE GREW PALE AS DEATH HIS EYES BECAME RED AND STARING HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE AND HIS BODY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY THEN HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS VISION
2289-152258-0025 PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
2289-152258-0026 ABOUT THIS TIME MOHAMMED'S UNCLE AND WIFE DIED AND HE HAD THEN HARDLY ANY FRIENDS IN MECCA HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO LEAVE THAT CITY AND GO TO MEDINA NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE THERE BELIEVED HIS DOCTRINES
2289-152258-0027 AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
2289-152258-0028 THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
2289-152258-0029 THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
2289-152258-0030 HE GAINED MANY VICTORIES HE MARCHED AGAINST MECCA WITH AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN AND THE CITY SURRENDERED WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE THE PEOPLE THEN JOINED HIS RELIGION AND DESTROYED THEIR IDOLS
2289-152258-0031 HE WAS BURIED IN THE MOSQUE IN WHICH HE HAD HELD RELIGIOUS SERVICES FOR SO MANY YEARS
2289-152258-0032 THAT THE BODY STILL LIES IN THE COFFIN IN THE SAME STATE AS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BURIED
2289-152258-0033 THAT THE COFFIN OF MOHAMMED RESTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THIS FABLE WAS INVENTED BY ENEMIES TO BRING RIDICULE ON THE PROPHET AND HIS RELIGION
2289-152258-0034 EVERY MUSSULMAN IS BOUND BY HIS RELIGION TO MAKE A VISIT OR PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE
2289-152258-0035 OF THE MOSQUE AND CHANTING IN A LOUD VOICE SUCH WORDS AS THESE COME TO PRAYER COME TO PRAYER THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD HE GIVETH LIFE AND HE DIETH NOT I PRAISE HIS PERFECTION GOD IS GREAT IN MECCA
2289-152258-0036 THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
2289-152258-0037 IT ITS WALL AT ONE CORNER IS THE CELEBRATED BLACK STONE MOSLEMS REGARD THIS STONE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THEY SAY THAT IT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONCE WHITE
2289-152258-0038 BUT HAS BECOME DARK FROM BEING WEPT UPON AND TOUCHED BY SO MANY MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS IT REALLY IS REDDISH BROWN IN COLOR BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED THE KA'A BA WAS A PAGAN TEMPLE
2289-152258-0039 BUT WHEN HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MECCA HE MADE THE OLD TEMPLE THE CENTRE OF WORSHIP FOR HIS OWN RELIGION AFTER MOHAMMED DIED A PERSON WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR AS HEAD OF THE MOSLEM CHURCH
2289-152258-0040 AND THIS TITLE HAS BEEN BORNE EVER SINCE BY THE RELIGIOUS CHIEF OF THE MOHAMMEDANS IN MODERN TIMES THE SULTANS OR RULERS OF TURKEY
