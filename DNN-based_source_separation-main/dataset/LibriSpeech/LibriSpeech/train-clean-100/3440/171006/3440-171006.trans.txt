3440-171006-0000 IN THAT HOUR JESUS REJOICED IN SPIRIT AND SAID I THANK THEE O FATHER LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT THOU HAST HID THESE THINGS FROM THE WISE AND PRUDENT AND HAST REVEALED THEM UNTO BABES EVEN SO FATHER FOR SO IT SEEMED GOOD IN THY SIGHT
3440-171006-0001 SAYS THE APOSTLE PAUL I SAY THE TRUTH IN CHRIST I LIE NOT MY CONSCIENCE ALSO BEARING ME WITNESS IN THE HOLY GHOST THAT I HAVE GREAT HEAVINESS AND CONTINUAL SORROW IN MY HEART
3440-171006-0002 MY KINSMEN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BRETHREN MY HEART'S DESIRE AND PRAYER TO GOD FOR ISRAEL IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND SUCH DEAR READER IS IN GREATER OR LESS DEGREE THE FEELING OF EVERY RENEWED HEART
3440-171006-0003 LOVING JESUS IT WOULD FAIN HAVE OTHERS LOVE HIM TOO IT DESIRES THE SALVATION OF ALL BUT FOR THAT OF ITS OWN DEAR ONES IT LONGS AND LABORS AND PRAYS IT IS LIKE JACOB WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL WHEN HE SAID
3440-171006-0004 I WILL NOT LET THEE GO EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME AND THUS IT WAS WITH ELSIE SHE KNEW NOW THAT HER FATHER WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO REAL LOVE FOR JESUS NONE OF THE TRUE FEAR OF GOD BEFORE HIS EYES
3440-171006-0005 SHE SAW THAT IF HE PERMITTED HER TO READ TO HIM FROM GOD'S WORD AS HE SOMETIMES DID IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY PLEASURE IN LISTENING BUT ONLY TO PLEASE HER SHE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE HE EVER PRAYED AND THOUGH HE WENT REGULARLY TO CHURCH
3440-171006-0006 IT WAS BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT PROPER AND RESPECTABLE TO DO SO AND NOT THAT HE CARED TO WORSHIP GOD OR TO LEARN HIS WILL THIS CONVICTION WHICH HAD GRADUALLY DAWNED UPON ELSIE UNTIL NOW IT AMOUNTED TO CERTAINTY CAUSED HER GREAT GRIEF
3440-171006-0007 SHE SHED MANY TEARS OVER IT IN SECRET AND VERY MANY AND VERY EARNEST WERE THE PRAYERS SHE OFFERED UP FOR HER DEAR FATHER'S CONVERSION SHE WAS SITTING ON HIS KNEE ONE EVENING IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHILE HE AND SEVERAL OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE CONVERSING ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION
3440-171006-0008 THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO A CHANGE OF HEART WERE NECESSARY TO SALVATION THE GENERAL OPINION SEEMED TO BE THAT IT WAS NOT AND ELSIE LISTENED WITH PAIN WHILE HER FATHER EXPRESSED HIS DECIDED CONVICTION THAT ALL WHO LED AN HONEST UPRIGHT MORAL LIFE
3440-171006-0009 AND ATTENDED TO THE OUTWARD OBSERVANCES OF RELIGION WERE QUITE SAFE HE COULD SEE NO NECESSITY FOR A CHANGE OF HEART HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DEPRAVITY NOT HE NO INDEED HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
3440-171006-0010 ELSIE FIXED HER EYES ON HIS FACE WITH A VERY MOURNFUL GAZE WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING BUT HE WAS BUSY WITH HIS ARGUMENT AND DID NOT NOTICE HER BUT ONE OF THE GUESTS WAS JUST EXPRESSING HIS APPROVAL OF MISTER DINSMORE'S SENTIMENTS WHEN CATCHING SIGHT OF ELSIE'S FACE
3440-171006-0011 HE STOPPED REMARKING YOUR LITTLE GIRL LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT WHAT IS IT MY DEAR ELSIE BLUSHED HESITATED AND LOOKED AT HER FATHER YES SPEAK MY DAUGHTER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY ELSIE LIFTED
3440-171006-0012 MARVEL NOT THAT I SAID UNTO THEE YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN SHE REPEATED THESE WORDS OF INSPIRATION WITH A DEEP EARNEST SOLEMNITY THAT SEEMED TO IMPRESS EVERY HEARER FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A DEEP HUSH IN THE ROOM THEN THE GENTLEMAN ASKED
3440-171006-0013 CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART O GOD AND RENEW A RIGHT SPIRIT WITHIN ME WHERE DID YOU LEARN ALL THIS HE ASKED LOOKING AT HER WITH MINGLED SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION IN THE BIBLE SIR SHE MODESTLY REPLIED YOU SEEM TO HAVE READ IT TO SOME PURPOSE SAID HE
3440-171006-0014 AND NOW SINCE YOU CONSIDER THAT CHANGE SO NECESSARY CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IT IS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT ALONE CAN CHANGE A SINNER'S HEART SIR AND HOW AM I TO SECURE HIS AID HE ASKED ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A TEXT
3440-171006-0015 SHE REPLIED THE SWEET LITTLE FACE ALL SUFFUSED WITH BLUSHES AND THE SOFT DOWNCAST EYES FILLING WITH TEARS WHY DO YOU THINK SO HE ASKED AGAIN
3440-171006-0016 I THINK THERE IS A TEXT THAT SAYS YOU MUST BE ABLE ALWAYS TO GIVE A REASON FOR THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT IS THERE NOT YES SIR BE READY ALWAYS TO GIVE AN ANSWER TO EVERY MAN THAT ASKETH YOU A REASON OF THE HOPE THAT IS IN YOU
3440-171006-0017 WITH MEEKNESS AND FEAR THEN RAISING HER EYES TO HIS FACE WITH A TOUCHING MIXTURE OF DEEP HUMILITY AND HOLY BOLDNESS SHE CONTINUED AND THIS SIR IS MY ANSWER JESUS SAYS HIM THAT COMETH UNTO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT
3440-171006-0018 AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
3440-171006-0019 AND NOW MISSUS DINSMORE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE SHOWN SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE SAID WELL ELSIE I THINK YOU HAVE NOW TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR A CHILD OF YOUR AGE THEN PULLING OUT HER WATCH IT IS HIGH TIME FOR LITTLE FOLKS TO BE IN BED ELSIE
3440-171006-0020 BLUSHING DEEPLY WOULD HAVE RETIRED IMMEDIATELY BUT HER FATHER HELD HER FAST SAYING AS HE GAVE HIS STEPMOTHER AN ANGRY GLANCE YOU NEED NOT GO ELSIE UNLESS YOU CHOOSE I AM QUITE CAPABLE OF JUDGING WHEN IT IS TIME TO SEND YOU TO BED
3440-171006-0021 WHISPERED ELSIE WHO HAD A GREAT DREAD OF MISSUS DINSMORE'S ANGER VERY WELL THEN YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE HE REPLIED GIVING HER A GOOD NIGHT KISS AND WITH A GRACEFUL GOOD NIGHT TO THE COMPANY THE LITTLE GIRL LEFT THE ROOM
3440-171006-0022 HER QUESTIONER FOLLOWED HER WITH AN ADMIRING GLANCE THEN TURNING TO HER FATHER EXCLAIMED WARMLY SHE IS A REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT CHILD DINSMORE ONE THAT ANY FATHER MIGHT BE PROUD OF I WAS ASTONISHED AT HER ANSWERS
