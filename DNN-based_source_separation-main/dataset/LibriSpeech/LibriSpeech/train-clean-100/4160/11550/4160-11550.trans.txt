4160-11550-0000 MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE HAS GONE AWAY HE WILL NOT COME BACK AGAIN UNTIL JULY WHEN HE IS TO MARRY MISS GOWER THIS WAS THE LAST ENTRY RECORDED IN THE LITTLE PINK AND GOLD JOURNAL AND AFTER IT CAME A GAP OF MONTHS
4160-11550-0001 IT WAS MIDNIGHT AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY SPENT IN BROOME STREET THAT THE RECORD WAS MADE AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH SHUT THE BOOK WITH A STARTLED FEELING THAT SHE HAD SHUT WITHIN ITS PAGES AN UNFINISHED PAGE OF HER LIFE IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO HAVE COME UPON HER SO SUDDENLY
4160-11550-0002 IT WAS STARTLING IT HAD COME UPON HER WITHOUT A MOMENT'S WARNING IT SEEMED AND YET IF SHE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF IT THERE HAD BEEN WARNING ENOUGH WARNING ENOUGH FOR AN OLDER WOMAN WARNING ENOUGH FOR DENIS OGLETHORPE
4160-11550-0003 BUT IT HAD NOT SEEMED WARNING TO A GIRL OF SCARCELY SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT NOW SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD IT THE MOMENT HE TOLD HER IN THAT STRAINED STEADY VOICE THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY SHE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE TO LADY THROCKMORTON
4160-11550-0004 AND LISTENED QUIETLY TO HER WANDERING COMMENTS ANSWERING THEM AS BEST SHE COULD SHE HAD WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL SIR DUGALD'S BARBAROUS ELEVEN O'CLOCK SUPPER WAS OVER AND THEN SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM STIRRED THE FIRE AND DROPPED DOWN UPON THE HEARTH RUG TO THINK IT OVER
4160-11550-0005 SHE THOUGHT OVER IT FOR A LONG TIME HER HANDSOME EYES BROODING OVER THE RED COALS BUT AFTER ABOUT HALF AN HOUR SHE SPOKE OUT ALOUD TO THE SILENCE OF THE ROOM HE LOVED ME SHE SAID HE LOVED ME ME POOR PRISCILLA
4160-11550-0006 THAT SHE WOULD RATHER LOSE HIM KNOWING HE LOVED HER THAN WIN HIM FEELING UNCERTAIN THE GLOW IN HER EYES DIED AWAY IN TEARS BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO REALIZE DESPAIR OR ANYTHING LIKE IT THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE CURIOUS ENCHANTMENT OF THE DAY HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER SAD
4160-11550-0007 AND AT SEVENTEEN ONE DOES NOT COMPREHEND THAT FATE CAN BE WHOLLY BITTER OR THAT SOME TURN IN FORTUNE IS NOT IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER HOPELESS THE PRESENT MAY SEEM IN THIS MOOD THE ENTRY WAS MADE IN THE LITTLE JOURNAL AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH CRIED A LITTLE HOPED A LITTLE
4160-11550-0008 AND WONDERED GUILELESSLY HOW MATTERS COULD END WITH PERFECT JUSTICE TO PRISCILLA GOWER THE HOUSEHOLD SEEMED RATHER QUIET AFTER THE CHANGE MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WAS A MAN TO BE MISSED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEO WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MISSED HIM
4160-11550-0009 LADY THROCKMORTON MISSED HIM ALSO BUT SHE HAD THE SOLACE OF HER NOVELS AND HER CHOCOLATE WHICH THEO HAD NOT NOVELS HAD BEEN DELIGHTFUL AT DOWNPORT WHEN THEY WERE READ IN HOURLY FEAR OF THE TASKS THAT ALWAYS INTERFERED TO PREVENT ANY INDULGENCE
4160-11550-0010 BUT IN THOSE DAYS FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE NOT AS SATISFACTORY AS THEY APPEARED ONCE AND SO BEING THROWN ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHE SUCCUMBED TO THE VERY NATURAL GIRLISH WEAKNESS OF FEELING A SORT OF FASCINATION FOR BROOME STREET IT WAS HARD TO RESIST BROOME STREET
4160-11550-0011 THIS WAS A CURIOUS CONSOLATION THE TWO SPENT HOURS TOGETHER SOMETIMES IN THE TINY PARLOR STUMBLING OVER BERLIN WOOL DIFFICULTIES AND NOW AND THEN WANDERING TO AND FRO CONVERSATIONALLY FROM PRISCILLA TO THE OCTAGON STITCH AND FROM THE OCTAGON STITCH TO DENIS
4160-11550-0012 AND SHE WAS SURE HER PALE HANDSOME FACE WAS PALER THOUGH OF COURSE THAT WAS EASILY TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY HER LOVER'S ABSENCE SHE WAS A SINGULAR GIRL THIS PRISCILLA GOWER THE FIRST TIME THEO EVER SAW HER DISPLAY AN INTEREST IN ANYBODY OR IN ANYTHING
4160-11550-0013 WAS WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD PAMELA'S LOVE STORY MENTIONED SHE WAS SITTING AT WORK NEAR THEM WHEN THEO CHANCED TO MENTION ARTHUR BRUNWALDE AND TO HER SURPRISE PRISCILLA LOOKED UP FROM HER DESK IMMEDIATELY HE WAS YOUR SISTER'S LOVER WAS HE NOT SHE SAID WITH AN ABRUPT INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT
4160-11550-0014 YES ANSWERED THEO BUT HE DIED YOU KNOW PRISCILLA NODDED THE WEEK BEFORE THEIR WEDDING DAY SHE SAID MISTER OGLETHORPE TOLD ME SO THEO ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AGAIN AND POOR PAM COULD NOT FORGET HIM SHE ADDED
4160-11550-0015 NO SHE REPLIED ALMOST TIMIDLY PAMELA IS FAIRER THAN I AM AND NOT SO TALL WE ARE NOT ALIKE AT ALL I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT SAID PRISCILLA I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE ALIKE IN DISPOSITION I THINK I WAS WONDERING MOST WHETHER YOU WOULD BE AS FAITHFUL AS PAMELA
4160-11550-0016 I REMEMBER HEARING MISTER OGLETHORPE SAY ONCE YOU WOULD BE THEO DROPPED HER IVORY CROCHET NEEDLE AND BENT TO PICK IT UP WITH A BLURRED VISION AND NERVOUS FINGERS I CANNOT TELL SHE SAID
4160-11550-0017 YOU ARE SEVENTEEN SAID PRISCILLA I KNEW AT SEVENTEEN THEO RECOVERED THE NEEDLE AND RESET IT IN HER WORK TO GIVE HERSELF TIME AND THEN SHE LOOKED UP AND FACED HER QUESTIONER BRAVELY IN A SORT OF DESPERATENESS IF I KNEW THAT I LOVED ANY ONE
4160-11550-0018 IF I HAD EVER LOVED ANY ONE AS PAMELA LOVED MISTER BRUNWALDE I SHOULD BE LIKE PAMELA SHE SAID I SHOULD NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE FROM THAT TIME SHE FANCIED THAT PRISCILLA GOWER LIKED HER BETTER THAN SHE HAD DONE BEFORE AT ANY RATE SHE TOOK MORE NOTICE OF HER THOUGH SHE WAS NEVER EFFUSIVE OF COURSE
4160-11550-0019 SHE TALKED TO HER OFTENER AND SEEMED TO LISTEN WHILE SHE TALKED EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BUSY AT THE TIME SHE SAID TO HER ONCE THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW PAMELA AND EMBOLDENED BY THIS THEO VENTURED TO BRING ONE OF PAM'S LETTERS TO READ TO HER
4160-11550-0020 AND WHEN SHE HAD READ IT TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF HER SISTER'S GENEROSITY IN A LITTLE BURST OF ENTHUSIASTIC LOVE AND GRATITUDE
4160-11550-0021 THAT FAIRLY MELTED TENDER HEARTED OLD MISS ELIZABETH TO TEARS AND CAUSED HER TO CONFIDE AFTERWARD TO THEO THE FACT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE TENDER PASSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A SINGLE GENTLEMAN OF UNCERTAIN AGE
4160-11550-0022 WHOSE PERFORMANCES UPON THE FLUTE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF WINNING HER AFFECTIONS BUT HAD UNHAPPILY RESULTED IN HIS CONTRACTING A FATAL COLD WHILE SERENADING ON A DAMP EVENING HE USED TO PLAY IN A COTTAGE NEAR A WOOD MY DEAR MOST BEAUTIFULLY SAID MISS ELIZABETH WILD WITH PATHOS
4160-11550-0023 THOUGH I REGRET TO SAY THAT AS WE DID NOT LIVE IN A MUSICAL NEIGHBORHOOD THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR DID NOT APPRECIATE IT THE GENTLEMAN OF THE HOUSE EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT SORRY WHEN HE DIED AS HE DID A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE COLD SETTLED ON HIS DEAR WEAK LUNGS
4160-11550-0024 HE WAS THE ONLY LOVER I EVER HAD MY DEAR THEODORA AND HIS NAME WAS ELDERBERRY A VERY SINGULAR NAME BY THE WAY BUT HE WAS A VERY TALENTED MAN WHEN THEO WENT INTO THE LITTLE BACK BEDROOM THAT EVENING TO PUT ON HER HAT PRISCILLA GOWER WENT WITH HER
4160-11550-0025 AND AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE DRESSING TABLE BUTTONING HER SACQUE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY THE EXPRESSION ON HER COMPANION'S FACE PRISCILLA HAD TAKEN UP HER MUFF AND WAS STROKING THE WHITE FUR HER EYES DOWNCAST UPON HER HAND AS IT MOVED TO AND FRO THE RING UPON ITS FOREFINGER SHINING IN THE GASLIGHT
4160-11550-0026 I HAD A LETTER FROM MISTER OGLETHORPE YESTERDAY PRISCILLA SAID AT LAST HE IS IN VIENNA NOW HE ASKED IF YOU WERE WELL TO NIGHT I SHALL ANSWER HIM HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE TO SEND I SAID THEO IT SEEMED TO HER SO STRANGE A THING FOR MISS PRISCILLA GOWER TO SAY
4160-11550-0027 THAT HER PRONOUN WAS ALMOST AN INTERJECTION I THOUGHT PERHAPS SAID PRISCILLA QUIETLY THAT A MESSAGE FROM YOU WOULD GRATIFY HIM IF YOU HAD ONE TO SEND THEO TOOK UP HER GLOVES AND BEGAN TO DRAW THEM ON A SUDDEN FEELING OF PAIN OR DISCOMFORT STRIKING HER
4160-11550-0028 IT WAS A FEELING SCARCELY DEFINED ENOUGH TO ALLOW HER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS REAL PAIN OR ONLY DISCOMFORT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ANY MESSAGE TO SEND SHE REPLIED THANK YOU MISS PRISCILLA SHE TOOK HER MUFF THEN
4160-11550-0029 AND WENT BACK TO THE PARLOR TO KISS MISS ELIZABETH IN A STRANGE FRAME OF MIND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE STRANGELY CONCERNING MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE AND IT WAS PRISCILLA GOWER WHO HAD STIRRED HER HEART SHE FOUND LADY THROCKMORTON WAITING AT HOME FOR HER TO HER SURPRISE IN A NEW MOOD
4160-11550-0030 SHE HAD THAT EVENING RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DENIS HERSELF AND IT HAD SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO HER I HAVE BEEN THINKING THEO SHE SAID THAT WE MIGHT TAKE A RUN OVER THE CHANNEL OURSELVES I HAVE NOT BEEN IN PARIS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I BELIEVE THE CHANGE WOULD DO ME GOOD
4160-11550-0031 THE LAST TIME I VISITED THE SPAS MY HEALTH IMPROVED GREATLY IT WAS JUST LIKE HER LADYSHIP TO BECOME SUDDENLY POSSESSED OF A WHIM AND TO FOLLOW ITS LEAD ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CAPRICES AND HER CAPRICES ALWAYS RULED THE DAY AS THIS ONE DID TO THEO'S GREAT ASTONISHMENT
4160-11550-0032 IT SEEMED SUCH A GREAT UNDERTAKING TO THEODORA THIS VOYAGE OF A FEW HOURS BUT LADY THROCKMORTON REGARDED IT AS THE LIGHTEST OF MATTERS TO HER IT WAS ONLY THE GIVING OF A FEW ORDERS BEING UNCOMFORTABLY SEA SICK FOR A WHILE AND THEN LANDING IN CALAIS
4160-11550-0033 SO WHEN THEO BROKE INTO EXCLAMATIONS OF PLEASURE AND ASTONISHMENT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER HER ENTHUSIASM OR HER SURPRISE WHAT SHE SAID YOU LIKE THE IDEA DO YOU
4160-11550-0034 WELL I THINK I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT WE COULD GO NEXT WEEK AND I DARE SAY WE COULD REACH VIENNA BEFORE DENIS OGLETHORPE GOES AWAY THEO BECAME SUDDENLY SILENT SHE GAVE VENT TO NO FURTHER EXCLAMATIONS SHE WOULD ALMOST HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GIVE UP THE PLEASURE OF THE JOURNEY AFTER THAT
4160-11550-0035 SHE WAS LEARNING THAT IT WAS BEST FOR HER NOT TO SEE DENIS OGLETHORPE AGAIN AND HERE IT SEEMED THAT SHE MUST SEE HIM IN SPITE OF HERSELF EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS CONSCIENTIOUS ENOUGH TO WISH TO DO WHAT WAS BEST NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS BEST FOR HERSELF AS BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TO PRISCILLA GOWER
4160-11550-0036 SHE WAS ACTUALLY GIRLISH AND SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO FANCY THAT MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE MIGHT IMAGINE THEIR INTENTION TO FOLLOW HIM WAS SOME FAULT OF HERS AND SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND NERVOUS ACCORDINGLY SHE HOPED HE WOULD HAVE LEFT VIENNA BEFORE THE LETTER REACHED HIM SHE HOPED HE MIGHT GO AWAY IN SPITE OF IT
4160-11550-0037 SHE HOPED IT MIGHT NEVER REACH HIM AT ALL AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS SHE EXPERIENCED AN ALMOST PASSIONATELY KEEN SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN ON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE LADY THROCKMORTON RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM REGRETTING HIS INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUEST
4160-11550-0038 AND ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE FOR SOME PLACE WHOSE NAME HE DID NOT MENTION BUSINESS HAD CALLED HIM AWAY AND LADY THROCKMORTON OF COURSE KNEW WHAT SUCH BUSINESS WAS AND HOW IMPERATIVE ITS DEMANDS WERE HE MIGHT HAVE WAITED THEO SAID TO HERSELF
4160-11550-0039 WITH AN UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENT FEELING OF WRETCHEDNESS I WOULD HAVE STAYED ANYWHERE TO HAVE SEEN HIM ONLY FOR A MINUTE HE HAD NO NEED TO BE SO READY TO GO AWAY
