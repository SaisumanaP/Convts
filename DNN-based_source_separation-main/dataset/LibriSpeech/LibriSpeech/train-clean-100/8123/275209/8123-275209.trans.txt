8123-275209-0000 THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
8123-275209-0001 WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
8123-275209-0002 YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
8123-275209-0003 DEAR ME IT IS A SAD PITY YOU CANNOT FLY YOURSELF BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER NURSE NOW SO YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST I HOPE DEAR DEAR
8123-275209-0004 AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
8123-275209-0005 WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
8123-275209-0006 OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
8123-275209-0007 HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
8123-275209-0008 SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
8123-275209-0009 WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
8123-275209-0010 SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275209-0012 AND THE CATERPILLAR SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO BEG HIM TO COME AND TALK TO HER AND WHEN HE CAME SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED HIM WHAT SHE WAS TO DO TO FEED AND REAR THE LITTLE CREATURES SO DIFFERENT FROM HERSELF
8123-275209-0013 PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
8123-275209-0014 SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
8123-275209-0015 SO SHE RESUMED HER WALK ROUND THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS NIBBLING A BIT OF THE CABBAGE LEAF NOW AND THEN AS SHE MOVED ALONG
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0017 DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
8123-275209-0018 NEVER SAID THE CATERPILLAR INDIGNANTLY IT WAS THEIR DYING MOTHER'S LAST REQUEST THAT I SHOULD DO NO SUCH THING THEIR DYING MOTHER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER PERSISTED THE LARK
8123-275209-0019 BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
8123-275209-0020 AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
8123-275209-0021 BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
8123-275209-0022 I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275209-0024 YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH
8123-275209-0025 I WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE NO MORE I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME CRIED THE LARK NETTLED IN HIS TURN I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT I AM TOLD PERSISTED THE CATERPILLAR THAT IS
8123-275209-0026 I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
8123-275209-0027 AS WELL AS YOU DO LOOK AT MY LONG GREEN BODY AND THESE ENDLESS LEGS AND THEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HAVING WINGS AND A PAINTED FEATHERY COAT FOOL AND FOOL YOU CRIED THE INDIGNANT LARK
8123-275209-0028 OH CATERPILLAR WHAT COMES TO YOU FROM THENCE RECEIVE AS I DO
8123-275209-0029 INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
8123-275209-0030 AND HAD ALREADY MADE A SHOW OF A HOLE IN THE CABBAGE LEAF THEY HAD BROKEN FROM THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS SHAME AND AMAZEMENT FILLED OUR GREEN FRIEND'S HEART BUT JOY SOON FOLLOWED
8123-275209-0031 FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
8123-275209-0032 AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
8123-275209-0033 AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
8123-275209-0034 AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
