6385-34669-0000 CHAPTER ONE A WATCH DOG MAY BE A GUARDIAN ANGEL GWYNPLAINE UTTERED A CRY IS THAT YOU WOLF HOMO WAGGED HIS TAIL HIS EYES SPARKLED IN THE DARKNESS HE WAS LOOKING EARNESTLY AT GWYNPLAINE
6385-34669-0001 THEN HE BEGAN TO LICK HIS HANDS AGAIN FOR A MOMENT GWYNPLAINE WAS LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN SO GREAT IS THE SHOCK OF HOPE'S MIGHTY RETURN HOMO
6385-34669-0002 OR AT LEAST THE LIGHT WHICH LEADS TO IT REGAINED THE SUDDEN INTERVENTION OF SOME MYSTERIOUS CLEMENCY POSSESSED PERHAPS BY DESTINY LIFE SAYING BEHOLD ME IN THE DARKEST RECESS OF THE GRAVE
6385-34669-0003 THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH ALL EXPECTATION HAS CEASED BRINGING BACK HEALTH AND DELIVERANCE A PLACE OF SAFETY DISCOVERED AT THE MOST CRITICAL INSTANT IN THE MIDST OF CRUMBLING RUINS HOMO WAS ALL THIS TO GWYNPLAINE THE WOLF APPEARED TO HIM
6385-34669-0004 IN A HALO OF LIGHT MEANWHILE HOMO HAD TURNED ROUND HE ADVANCED A FEW STEPS AND THEN LOOKED BACK TO SEE IF GWYNPLAINE WAS FOLLOWING HIM GWYNPLAINE WAS DOING SO HOMO WAGGED HIS TAIL AND WENT ON
6385-34669-0005 AND GWYNPLAINE GUIDED BY HOMO DESCENDED IT HOMO TURNED HIS HEAD NOW AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT GWYNPLAINE WAS BEHIND HIM IN SOME SITUATIONS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE NOTHING APPROACHES SO NEAR AN OMNISCIENT INTELLIGENCE
6385-34669-0006 AS THE SIMPLE INSTINCT OF A FAITHFUL ANIMAL AN ANIMAL IS A LUCID SOMNAMBULIST THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH THE DOG FEELS THAT HE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS MASTER OTHERS IN WHICH HE SHOULD PRECEDE HIM THEN THE ANIMAL TAKES THE DIRECTION OF SENSE
6385-34669-0007 HIS IMPERTURBABLE SCENT IS A CONFUSED POWER OF VISION IN WHAT IS TWILIGHT TO US HE FEELS A VAGUE OBLIGATION TO BECOME A GUIDE DOES HE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DANGEROUS PASS AND THAT HE CAN HELP HIS MASTER TO SURMOUNT IT
6385-34669-0008 PROBABLY NOT PERHAPS HE DOES IN ANY CASE SOME ONE KNOWS IT FOR HIM AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN LIFE THAT SOME MIGHTY HELP
6385-34669-0009 WHICH WE HAVE HELD TO HAVE COME FROM BELOW HAS IN REALITY COME FROM ABOVE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS FORMS ASSUMED BY GOD WHAT WAS THIS ANIMAL PROVIDENCE HAVING REACHED THE RIVER
6385-34669-0010 WITHOUT NOISE OR BARK HE PUSHED FORWARD ON HIS SILENT WAY HOMO ALWAYS FOLLOWED HIS INSTINCT AND DID HIS DUTY BUT WITH THE PENSIVE RESERVE OF AN OUTLAW SOME FIFTY PACES MORE AND HE STOPPED
6385-34669-0011 A WOODEN PLATFORM APPEARED ON THE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PLATFORM WHICH WAS A KIND OF WHARF ON PILES
6385-34669-0012 A BLACK MASS COULD BE MADE OUT WHICH WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE VESSEL ON THE DECK OF THE VESSEL NEAR THE PROW WAS A GLIMMER LIKE THE LAST FLICKER OF A NIGHT LIGHT
6385-34669-0013 WAS A DUTCH VESSEL OF THE JAPANESE BUILD WITH TWO DECKS FORE AND AFT AND BETWEEN THEM AN OPEN HOLD REACHED BY AN UPRIGHT LADDER IN WHICH THE CARGO WAS LADEN
6385-34669-0014 THERE WAS THUS A FORECASTLE AND AN AFTERDECK AS IN OUR OLD RIVER BOATS AND A SPACE BETWEEN THEM BALLASTED BY THE FREIGHT THE PAPER BOATS MADE BY CHILDREN ARE OF A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR SHAPE UNDER THE DECKS WERE THE CABINS
6385-34669-0015 THE DOORS OF WHICH OPENED INTO THE HOLD AND WERE LIGHTED BY GLAZED PORTHOLES IN STOWING THE CARGO A PASSAGE WAS LEFT BETWEEN THE PACKAGES OF WHICH IT CONSISTED THESE VESSELS HAD A MAST ON EACH DECK THE FOREMAST WAS CALLED PAUL
6385-34669-0016 BOTH FLAPS OF THE GANGWAY WERE LOWERED ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ON HINGES THUS MAKING A ROOF OVER THE HOLD SO THAT THE SHIP IN HEAVY SEAS WAS HERMETICALLY CLOSED THESE SLOOPS BEING OF VERY MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION HAD A BEAM FOR A TILLER
6385-34669-0017 THE STRENGTH OF THE RUDDER BEING NECESSARILY PROPORTIONED TO THE HEIGHT OF THE VESSEL THREE MEN THE SKIPPER AND TWO SAILORS WITH A CABIN BOY SUFFICED TO NAVIGATE THESE PONDEROUS SEA GOING MACHINES THE DECKS FORE AND AFT
6385-34669-0018 THE GREAT LUMBERING HULL OF THIS PARTICULAR VESSEL WAS PAINTED BLACK AND ON IT VISIBLE EVEN IN THE NIGHT STOOD OUT IN WHITE LETTERS THE WORDS VOGRAAT ROTTERDAM
6385-34669-0019 ABOUT THAT TIME MANY EVENTS HAD OCCURRED AT SEA AND AMONGST OTHERS THE DEFEAT OF THE BARON DE POINTI'S EIGHT SHIPS OFF CAPE CARNERO WHICH HAD DRIVEN THE WHOLE FRENCH FLEET INTO REFUGE AT GIBRALTAR SO THAT THE CHANNEL WAS SWEPT OF EVERY MAN OF WAR
6385-34669-0020 AND MERCHANT VESSELS WERE ABLE TO SAIL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN LONDON AND ROTTERDAM WITHOUT A CONVOY THE VESSEL ON WHICH WAS TO BE READ THE WORD VOGRAAT AND WHICH GWYNPLAINE WAS NOW CLOSE TO LAY WITH HER MAIN DECK ALMOST LEVEL WITH THE WHARF
6385-34669-0021 BUT ONE STEP TO DESCEND AND HOMO IN A BOUND AND GWYNPLAINE IN A STRIDE WERE ON BOARD THE DECK WAS CLEAR AND NO STIR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE PASSENGERS IF AS WAS LIKELY THERE WERE ANY WERE ALREADY ON BOARD
6385-34669-0022 THE VESSEL BEING READY TO SAIL AND THE CARGO STOWED AS WAS APPARENT FROM THE STATE OF THE HOLD WHICH WAS FULL OF BALES AND CASES BUT THEY WERE DOUBTLESS LYING ASLEEP IN THE CABINS BELOW AS THE PASSAGE WAS TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE NIGHT
6385-34669-0023 IN SUCH CASES THE PASSENGERS DO NOT APPEAR ON DECK TILL THEY AWAKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS FOR THE CREW THEY WERE PROBABLY HAVING THEIR SUPPER IN THE MEN'S CABIN WHILST AWAITING THE HOUR FIXED FOR SAILING WHICH WAS NOW RAPIDLY APPROACHING HENCE
6385-34669-0024 THE SILENCE ON THE TWO DECKS CONNECTED BY THE GANGWAY THE WOLF HAD ALMOST RUN ACROSS THE WHARF ONCE ON BOARD HE SLACKENED HIS PACE INTO A DISCREET WALK HE STILL WAGGED HIS TAIL NO LONGER JOYFULLY HOWEVER
6385-34669-0025 THIS POOR WOODEN TENEMENT CART AND HUT COMBINED IN WHICH HIS CHILDHOOD HAD ROLLED ALONG WAS FASTENED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MAST BY THICK ROPES OF WHICH THE KNOTS WERE VISIBLE AT THE WHEELS HAVING BEEN SO LONG OUT OF SERVICE IT HAD BECOME DREADFULLY RICKETY
6385-34669-0026 IT LEANT OVER FEEBLY ON ONE SIDE IT HAD BECOME QUITE PARALYTIC FROM DISUSE AND MOREOVER IT WAS SUFFERING FROM THAT INCURABLE MALADY OLD AGE MOULDY AND OUT OF SHAPE IT TOTTERED IN DECAY
6385-34669-0027 THE IRON WAS RUSTY THE LEATHER TORN THE WOOD WORK WORM EATEN THERE WERE LINES OF CRACKS ACROSS THE WINDOW IN FRONT THROUGH WHICH SHONE A RAY FROM THE LANTERN THE WHEELS WERE WARPED THE LINING THE FLOOR
6385-34669-0028 AND THE AXLETREES SEEMED WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE ALTOGETHER IT PRESENTED AN INDESCRIBABLE APPEARANCE OF BEGGARY AND PROSTRATION THE SHAFTS STUCK UP LOOKED LIKE TWO ARMS RAISED TO HEAVEN
6385-34669-0029 THE WHOLE THING WAS IN A STATE OF DISLOCATION BENEATH IT WAS HANGING HOMO'S CHAIN
6385-34669-0030 DOES IT NOT SEEM THAT THE LAW AND THE WILL OF NATURE WOULD HAVE DICTATED GWYNPLAINE'S HEADLONG RUSH TO THROW HIMSELF UPON LIFE HAPPINESS LOVE REGAINED SO THEY WOULD
6385-34669-0031 HESITATES LEST HE SHOULD BEAR THE FATALITY OF WHICH HE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM TO THOSE WHOM HE LOVES FEELS THAT SOME EVIL CONTAGION MAY STILL HANG ABOUT HIM AND ADVANCES TOWARDS HAPPINESS WITH WARY STEPS
6385-34669-0032 THE GATES OF PARADISE REOPEN BUT BEFORE HE ENTERS HE EXAMINES HIS GROUND
