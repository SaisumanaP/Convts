5192-19396-0000 THE FATES WHO CERTAINLY ALL FORE KNEW OF THESE AMOURS OF WIDOW WADMAN AND MY UNCLE TOBY HAD FROM THE FIRST CREATION OF MATTER AND MOTION AND WITH MORE COURTESY THAN THEY USUALLY DO THINGS OF THIS KIND ESTABLISHED SUCH A CHAIN OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS HANGING SO FAST TO ONE ANOTHER
5192-19396-0001 THAT IT WAS SCARCE POSSIBLE FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TO HAVE DWELT IN ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE WORLD OR TO HAVE OCCUPIED ANY OTHER GARDEN IN CHRISTENDOM BUT THE VERY HOUSE AND GARDEN WHICH JOIN'D AND LAID PARALLEL TO MISSUS WADMAN'S THIS WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF A THICKSET
5192-19396-0002 ARBOUR IN MISSUS WADMAN'S GARDEN BUT PLANTED IN THE HEDGE ROW OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S PUT ALL THE OCCASIONS INTO HER HANDS WHICH LOVE MILITANCY WANTED SHE COULD OBSERVE MY UNCLE TOBY'S MOTIONS
5192-19396-0003 QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING HIM AS HE MENTIONED THE BLIND GUT IN A DISCOURSE WITH MY FATHER THE NIGHT MY MOTHER WAS BROUGHT TO BED OF ME I BESEECH YOU QUOTH MY UNCLE TOBY TO TELL ME WHICH IS THE BLIND GUT FOR OLD AS I AM I VOW I DO NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHERE IT LIES
5192-19396-0004 THE BLIND GUT ANSWERED DOCTOR SLOP LIES BETWIXT THE ILION AND COLON IN A MAN SAID MY FATHER
5192-19396-0005 IN A WOMAN THAT'S MORE THAN I KNOW QUOTH MY FATHER
5192-19396-0006 NEITHER AT THIS END OR THAT BUT LIKE A PRODIGAL'S CANDLE TO LIGHT HIM IF POSSIBLE AT BOTH ENDS AT ONCE NOW THROUGH ALL THE LUMBER ROOMS OF MILITARY FURNITURE INCLUDING BOTH OF HORSE AND FOOT
5192-19396-0007 AND WITH BRIDGET TO HELP HER SHE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND ANY ONE BLIND OR MANTELET SO FIT FOR HER PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH THE EXPEDIENCY OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S AFFAIRS HAD FIX'D UP READY TO HER HANDS I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU BUT I DON'T KNOW POSSIBLY I HAVE BE IT AS IT WILL
5192-19396-0008 TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
5192-19396-0009 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS LEFT HAND TO HAVE A PLAN OF THE PLACE FASTEN'D UP WITH TWO OR THREE PINS AT THE TOP BUT LOOSE AT THE BOTTOM
5192-19396-0010 SO THAT WHEN AN ATTACK WAS RESOLVED UPON MISSUS WADMAN HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO WHEN SHE HAD GOT ADVANCED TO THE DOOR OF THE SENTRY BOX BUT TO EXTEND HER RIGHT HAND
5192-19396-0011 TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MAP OR PLAN OR UPRIGHT OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND WITH OUT STRETCHED NECK MEETING IT HALF WAY TO ADVANCE IT TOWARDS HER ON WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY'S PASSIONS WERE SURE TO CATCH FIRE FOR HE WOULD INSTANTLY TAKE HOLD OF THE OTHER CORNER OF THE MAP IN HIS LEFT HAND
5192-19396-0012 AND WITH THE END OF HIS PIPE IN THE OTHER BEGIN AN EXPLANATION WHEN THE ATTACK WAS ADVANCED TO THIS POINT THE WORLD WILL NATURALLY ENTER INTO THE REASONS OF MISSUS WADMAN'S NEXT STROKE OF GENERALSHIP WHICH WAS TO TAKE MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE OUT OF HIS HAND AS SOON AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD WHICH
5192-19396-0013 UNDER ONE PRETENCE OR OTHER BUT GENERALLY THAT OF POINTING MORE DISTINCTLY AT SOME REDOUBT OR BREASTWORK IN THE MAP SHE WOULD EFFECT BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY POOR SOUL HAD WELL MARCH'D ABOVE HALF A DOZEN TOISES WITH IT IT OBLIGED MY UNCLE TOBY TO MAKE USE OF HIS FOREFINGER
5192-19396-0014 THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN THE ATTACK WAS THIS THAT IN GOING UPON IT AS IN THE FIRST CASE WITH THE END OF HER FORE FINGER AGAINST THE END OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE SHE MIGHT HAVE TRAVELLED WITH IT ALONG THE LINES FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA HAD MY UNCLE TOBY'S LINES REACH'D SO FAR
5192-19396-0015 WITHOUT ANY EFFECT FOR AS THERE WAS NO ARTERIAL OR VITAL HEAT IN THE END OF THE TOBACCO PIPE IT COULD EXCITE NO SENTIMENT IT COULD NEITHER GIVE FIRE BY PULSATION OR RECEIVE IT BY SYMPATHY
5192-19396-0016 WHEREAS IN FOLLOWING MY UNCLE TOBY'S FOREFINGER WITH HERS CLOSE THRO ALL THE LITTLE TURNS AND INDENTINGS OF HIS WORKS PRESSING SOMETIMES AGAINST THE SIDE OF IT THEN TREADING UPON ITS NAIL THEN TRIPPING IT UP THEN TOUCHING IT HERE THEN THERE AND SO ON
5192-19396-0017 IT SET SOMETHING AT LEAST IN MOTION THIS THO SLIGHT SKIRMISHING AND AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN BODY YET DREW ON THE REST FOR HERE THE MAP USUALLY FALLING WITH THE BACK OF IT CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE SENTRY BOX MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0018 IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS SOUL WOULD LAY HIS HAND FLAT UPON IT IN ORDER TO GO ON WITH HIS EXPLANATION AND MISSUS WADMAN BY A MANOEUVRE AS QUICK AS THOUGHT WOULD AS CERTAINLY PLACE HER'S CLOSE BESIDE IT THIS AT ONCE OPENED A COMMUNICATION
5192-19396-0019 LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SENTIMENT TO PASS OR RE PASS WHICH A PERSON SKILL'D IN THE ELEMENTARY AND PRACTICAL PART OF LOVE MAKING HAS OCCASION FOR BY BRINGING UP HER FOREFINGER PARALLEL AS BEFORE TO MY UNCLE TOBY'S IT UNAVOIDABLY BROUGHT THE THUMB INTO ACTION
5192-19396-0020 AND THE FOREFINGER AND THUMB BEING ONCE ENGAGED AS NATURALLY BROUGHT IN THE WHOLE HAND THINE DEAR UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0021 MISSUS WADMAN HAD IT EVER TO TAKE UP OR WITH THE GENTLEST PUSHINGS PROTRUSIONS AND EQUIVOCAL COMPRESSIONS THAT A HAND TO BE REMOVED IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING TO GET IT PRESS'D A HAIR BREADTH OF ONE SIDE OUT OF HER WAY
5192-19396-0022 WHILST THIS WAS DOING HOW COULD SHE FORGET TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE
5192-19396-0023 WHICH SLIGHTLY PRESS'D AGAINST THE CALF OF HIS
5192-19396-0024 WAS IT A WONDER IF NOW AND THEN IT PUT HIS CENTRE INTO DISORDER THE DUCE TAKE IT SAID MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0025 YOU WILL READILY CONCEIVE TO BE OF DIFFERENT KINDS VARYING FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE ATTACKS WHICH HISTORY IS FULL OF AND FROM THE SAME REASONS A GENERAL LOOKER ON WOULD SCARCE ALLOW THEM TO BE ATTACKS AT ALL OR IF HE DID WOULD CONFOUND THEM ALL TOGETHER BUT I WRITE NOT TO THEM
5192-19396-0026 IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXACT IN MY DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM AS I COME UP TO THEM WHICH WILL NOT BE FOR SOME CHAPTERS HAVING NOTHING MORE TO ADD IN THIS BUT THAT IN A BUNDLE OF ORIGINAL PAPERS AND DRAWINGS WHICH MY FATHER TOOK CARE TO ROLL UP BY THEMSELVES
5192-19396-0027 THERE IS A PLAN OF BOUCHAIN IN PERFECT PRESERVATION AND SHALL BE KEPT SO WHILST I HAVE POWER TO PRESERVE ANY THING UPON THE LOWER CORNER OF WHICH ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE IS STILL REMAINING THE MARKS OF A SNUFFY FINGER AND THUMB
5192-19396-0028 WHICH THERE IS ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO IMAGINE WERE MISSUS WADMAN'S FOR THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MARGIN WHICH I SUPPOSE TO HAVE BEEN MY UNCLE TOBY'S IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAN THIS SEEMS AN AUTHENTICATED RECORD OF ONE OF THESE ATTACKS
5192-19396-0029 BUT STILL VISIBLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE MAP WHICH ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE VERY HOLES THROUGH WHICH IT HAS BEEN PRICKED UP IN THE SENTRY BOX BY ALL THAT IS PRIESTLY I VALUE THIS PRECIOUS RELICK WITH ITS STIGMATA AND PRICKS MORE THAN ALL THE RELICKS OF THE ROMISH CHURCH
5192-19396-0030 ALWAYS EXCEPTING WHEN I AM WRITING UPON THESE MATTERS THE PRICKS WHICH ENTERED THE FLESH OF SAINT RADAGUNDA IN THE DESERT WHICH IN YOUR ROAD FROM FESSE TO CLUNY THE NUNS OF THAT NAME WILL SHEW YOU FOR LOVE
5192-19396-0031 THE FORTIFICATIONS ARE QUITE DESTROYED
5192-19396-0032 I THINK SO TOO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY WITH A SIGH HALF SUPPRESS'D BUT STEP INTO THE PARLOUR TRIM FOR THE STIPULATION IT LIES UPON THE TABLE IT HAS LAIN THERE THESE SIX WEEKS REPLIED THE CORPORAL TILL THIS VERY MORNING THAT THE OLD WOMAN KINDLED THE FIRE WITH IT
