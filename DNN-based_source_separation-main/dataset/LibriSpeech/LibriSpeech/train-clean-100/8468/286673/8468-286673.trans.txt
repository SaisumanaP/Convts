8468-286673-0000 THE SLOW LITTLE MUD TURTLE WHEN THE TWENTY LITTLE MUD TURTLES BROKE THEIR EGG SHELLS ONE HOT SUMMER DAY AND POKED THEIR WAY UP THROUGH THE WARM SAND IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THEY LOOKED ALMOST AS MUCH ALIKE AS SO MANY RAINDROPS
8468-286673-0001 THE MOTHER TURTLE WHO WAS SUNNING HERSELF ON THE BANK NEAR BY SAID TO HER FRIENDS WHY THERE ARE MY CHILDREN DID YOU EVER SEE A FINER FAMILY I BELIEVE I WILL GO OVER AND SPEAK TO THEM
8468-286673-0002 AND THEN SAT DOWN UNTIL IT SHOULD STOP ACHING WAIT FOR ME HE CALLED OUT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I'M COMING IN A MINUTE THE OTHER LITTLE TURTLES WAITED BUT WHEN HIS TOE WAS COMFORTABLE AGAIN AND HE STARTED TOWARD THEM HE MET A VERY INTERESTING SNAIL
8468-286673-0003 AND TALKED A WHILE WITH HIM COME ON SAID THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE DON'T LET'S WAIT ANY LONGER HE CAN CATCH UP SO THEY SPRAWLED ALONG UNTIL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SIT IN A ROW ON AN OLD LOG AND THEY CLIMBED ONTO IT AND SAT JUST CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER
8468-286673-0004 AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
8468-286673-0005 YOU CERTAINLY ARE FOR I SAW YOU SCRAMBLING OUT OF THE SAND A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND YOU CAME FROM THE VERY PLACE WHERE I LAID MY EGGS AND COVERED THEM DURING THE FIRST REALLY WARM NIGHTS THIS YEAR I WAS TELLING YOUR FATHER ONLY YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR YOU TO HATCH
8468-286673-0006 THE SUN HAS BEEN SO HOT LATELY THAT I WAS SURE YOU WOULD DO WELL THE MOTHER TURTLE STRETCHED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL THERE WAS HARDLY A WRINKLE LEFT IN HER NECK SKIN SHE WAS SO EAGER TO SEE THEM ALL
8468-286673-0007 WHY ARE YOU NOT UP HERE WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE ASKED SUDDENLY OF THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WHO WAS TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR HIMSELF ON THE LOG THEY DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME HE SAID I WAS COMING RIGHT ALONG BUT THEY WOULDN'T WAIT I THINK THEY ARE JUST AS MEA
8468-286673-0008 THE MOTHER TURTLE RAISED ONE OF HER FOREFEET UNTIL ALL FIVE OF ITS TOES WITH THEIR STRONG CLAWS WERE POINTING AT HIM SHE ALSO RAISED HER HEAD AS FAR AS HER UPPER SHELL WOULD LET HER SO YOU ARE THE ONE SHE SAID
8468-286673-0009 I THOUGHT YOU WERE WHEN I HEARD YOU TRYING TO MAKE THE OTHERS WAIT IT IS TOO BAD
8468-286673-0010 YET DOWN IN HIS LITTLE TURTLE HEART HE THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH IT HE WAS SURE HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SCOLD THE OTHER TURTLE CHILDREN FOR LEAVING HIM HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO SO HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE AT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THAT SIDE
8468-286673-0011 THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0012 WHO LAGS BEHIND AND WANTS THE OTHERS TO WAIT FOR HIM THAT MAKES HIM MISS HIS SHARE OF GOOD THINGS AND THEN HE IS QUITE CERTAIN TO BE CROSS AND THINK IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE FELT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON HIS RIGHT SIDE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF THEIR LEFT EYES
8468-286673-0013 AND THE NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON HIS LEFT SIDE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF THEIR RIGHT EYES HE DREW IN HIS HEAD AND HIS TAIL AND HIS LEGS UNTIL ALL THEY COULD SEE WAS HIS ROUNDED UPPER SHELL HIS SHELL SIDE WALLS AND THE YELLOW EDGE OF HIS FLAT LOWER SHELL
8468-286673-0014 I DID HOPE SAID THE MOTHER TURTLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE ONE FAMILY WITHOUT SUCH A CHILD IN IT I CANNOT HELP LOVING EVEN A SLOW CHILD WHO IS CROSS IF HE IS HATCHED FROM ONE OF MY EGGS YET IT MAKES ME SAD VERY VERY SAD
8468-286673-0015 AND YOU SHE ADDED TURNING TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS MUST BE PATIENT WITH HIM WE SHALL NOT HAVE HIM WITH US LONG
8468-286673-0016 I REMEMBER SO WELL MY FIRST SLOW CHILD AND HOW HE SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SINCE SHE COULD NOT EASILY GET HER FOREFEET TO HER EYES SHE SPRAWLED TO THE POND AND SWAM OFF WITH ONLY HER HEAD AND A LITTLE OF HER UPPER SHELL SHOWING ABOVE THE WATER
8468-286673-0017 THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SAID AND FOR A FEW DAYS HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND SO HE GREW CARELESS AND MADE PEOPLE WAIT FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NOT QUITE READY TO GO WITH THEM
8468-286673-0018 OR BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO THIS OR LOOK AT THAT OR TALK TO SOME OTHER PERSON HE WAS A VERY TRYING LITTLE TURTLE YET HIS MOTHER LOVED HIM AND DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN THE REST CALLED HIM A LAND TORTOISE IT IS ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW TO BE A LAND TORTOISE WHEN YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER ARE LAND TORTOISES
8468-286673-0019 AND THESE COUSINS OF THE TURTLES LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THEM THAT SOME PEOPLE CANNOT TELL THEM APART THAT IS BECAUSE THEY FORGET THAT THE TORTOISES LIVE ON LAND HAVE HIGHER BACK SHELLS AND MOVE VERY VERY SLOWLY TURTLES LIVE MORE IN THE WATER
8468-286673-0020 AND CAN MOVE QUICKLY IF THEY WILL THIS IS WHY OTHER TURTLES SOMETIMES MAKE FUN OF A SLOW BROTHER BY CALLING HIM A LAND TORTOISE ONE BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINY AFTERNOON WHEN MOST OF THE TWENTY LITTLE TURTLES WERE SITTING ON A FLOATING LOG BY THE EDGE OF THE POND
8468-286673-0021 THEIR MOTHER WAS WITH SOME OF HER FRIENDS ON ANOTHER LOG NEAR BY SHE LOOKED OFTEN AT HER CHILDREN AND THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME THEIR ROUNDED UP BACK SHELLS WERE IN THE SUNSHINE WITH THE LITTLE RED AND YELLOW MARKINGS SHOWING ON THE BLACK
8468-286673-0022 SHE COULD SEE THEIR STRONG LITTLE POINTED TAILS TOO AND THEIR WEBBED FEET WITH A STOUT CLAW ON EACH TOE SHE WAS SO PROUD THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP TALKING ABOUT THEM
8468-286673-0023 YES SAID A FINE OLD FELLOW WHO WAS FLOATING NEAR HER A ROW OF THEIR MOTHERS HE WAS A TURTLE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER LIKED VERY WELL BUT NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS RATHER AGREEABLE AFTER ALL
8468-286673-0024 SHE WAS JUST NOTICING HOW BEAUTIFULLY THE SKIN WRINKLED ON HIS NECK WHEN SHE HEARD A SPLASH AND SAW TWO TERRIBLE GREAT TWO LEGGED ANIMALS WADING INTO THE POND FROM THE SHORE BOYS SHE CRIED BOYS AND SHE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HER LOG
8468-286673-0025 AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0026 THEN ONE OF THESE GREAT ANIMALS STOOPED OVER AND PICKED HIM UP AND HELD HIM BOTTOM SIDE UPPERMOST AND RAPPED ON THAT SIDE WHICH WAS FLAT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WAS ROUNDED AND STARED AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT EYES
8468-286673-0027 NEXT THE OTHER GREAT ANIMAL TOOK HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AND RAPPED ON HIS SHELLS AND STARED AT HIM
8468-286673-0028 HE WAS THINKING OVER AND OVER SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND HE KNEW THAT BACK IN THE POND HIS MOTHER WOULD BE TRYING TO FIND HIM AND COULD NOT THE BOYS CARRIED HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW AND PUT HIM DOWN ON THE GRASS
8468-286673-0029 HE LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY THEN THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED HIM UP AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING SHARP AND SHINY AND CUT MARKS INTO HIS UPPER SHELL
8468-286673-0030 THIS DID NOT REALLY GIVE HIM PAIN YET AS HE SAID AFTERWARD IT HURTS ALMOST AS MUCH TO THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE HURT AS IT DOES TO BE HURT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SUN WENT DOWN THAT THE BOYS LET THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE GO
8468-286673-0031 THEN HE WAS VERY VERY TIRED BUT HE WANTED SO MUCH TO GET BACK TO HIS HOME IN THE POND THAT HE STARTED AT ONCE BY MOONLIGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER SEEN THE MOON FOR EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE LAYING EGGS TURTLES USUALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT
8468-286673-0032 I WISH I MIGHT HELP YOU SOME TIME
8468-286673-0033 I'M HERE HE CRIED JOYFULLY POKING FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER OF THEM WITH HIS HEAD THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE MOVED WITHOUT AWAKENING I TELL YOU I'M NOT HUNGRY HE MURMURED
8468-286673-0034 AND AGAIN HE FELL FAST ASLEEP
8468-286673-0035 BUT CUDDLED INSIDE HIS TWO SHELLS AND WENT TO SLEEP ALSO HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS EYES HIS RELATIVES WERE SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT HIM AND HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE SLEPT
8468-286673-0036 DOES MY SHELL LOOK VERY BAD HE CRIED I WISH I COULD SEE IT OH I AM SO GLAD TO GET BACK I'LL NEVER BE SLOW AGAIN NEVER NEVER HIS MOTHER CAME AND LEANED HER SHELL LOVINGLY AGAINST HIS
8468-286673-0037 IF YOU WILL ONLY LEARN TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE SAID I SHALL NOT BE SORRY THAT THE BOYS CARRIED YOU OFF YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE SAID THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE AND HE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AFTER THAT
8468-286673-0038 HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SLIP FROM THE LOG TO THE WATER IF ANYTHING SCARED THEM AND WHEN ONE DAY A STRANGE TURTLE FROM ANOTHER POND CAME TO VISIT HE SAID TO THE TURTLES WHO HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
8468-286673-0039 HE IS THE QUICKEST ONE IN HIS FAMILY THE POND PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED THAT IS QUEER THEY SAID AFTER THIS WE WILL CALL HIM THE QUICK LITTLE TURTLE THIS MADE HIM VERY HAPPY AND WHEN ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY FORGOT
8468-286673-0040 AND BY MISTAKE CALLED HIM THE QUICK SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
