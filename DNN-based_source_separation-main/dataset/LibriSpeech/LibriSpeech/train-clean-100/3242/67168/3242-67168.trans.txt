3242-67168-0000 I NEVER SELL GOODS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I CAN FIND THEM WHEN I WANT THEM AND IF THESE FELLOWS TRY TO PUT THEIR FOREFEET IN THE TROUGH OR START ANY SHOVING AND CROWDING THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ME FORGETTING MY TABLE MANNERS TOO
3242-67168-0001 FOR WHEN IT COMES TO FUNNY BUSINESS I'M SOMETHING OF A HUMORIST MYSELF AND WHILE I'M TOO OLD TO RUN I'M YOUNG ENOUGH TO STAND AND FIGHT FIRST AND LAST A GOOD MANY MEN HAVE GONE GUNNING FOR ME BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS PLANNED THE OBSEQUIES BEFORE THEY CAUGHT THE DECEASED
3242-67168-0002 I RECKON THERE HASN'T BEEN A TIME IN TWENTY YEARS WHEN THERE WASN'T A NICE GATES AJAR PIECE ALL MADE UP AND READY FOR ME IN SOME OFFICE NEAR THE BOARD OF TRADE BUT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF A QUIET FUNERAL IS A WILLING CORPSE AND I'M STILL SITTING UP AND TAKING NOURISHMENT
3242-67168-0003 ABUSE AND FLATTERY THE FIRST CAN'T HARM YOU AND THE SECOND CAN'T HELP YOU SOME MEN ARE LIKE YELLOW DOGS
3242-67168-0004 LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS BULLING THE MARKET THE LONGS ALL SAID THAT I WAS A KIND HEARTED OLD PHILANTHROPIST WHO WAS LAYING AWAKE NIGHTS SCHEMING TO GET THE FARMERS A TOP PRICE FOR THEIR HOGS
3242-67168-0005 AND THE SHORTS ALLOWED THAT I WAS AN INFAMOUS OLD ROBBER WHO WAS STEALING THE PORK OUT OF THE WORKINGMAN'S POT AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T PLEASE BOTH SIDES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PLEASING YOUR OWN SIDE
3242-67168-0006 I REMEMBER ONCE I HAD A VACANT LOT OUT ON THE AVENUE AND A LADY CAME IN TO MY OFFICE AND IN A SOOTHING SYRUPY WAY ASKED IF I WOULD LEND IT TO HER AS SHE WANTED TO BUILD A CRECHE ON IT I HESITATED A LITTLE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF A CRECHE BEFORE
3242-67168-0007 AND SOMEWAYS IT SOUNDED SORT OF FOREIGN AND FRISKY THOUGH THE WOMAN LOOKED LIKE A GOOD SAFE RELIABLE OLD HEIFER BUT SHE EXPLAINED THAT A CRECHE WAS A BABY FARM WHERE OLD MAIDS WENT TO WASH AND FEED AND STICK PINS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN WHILE THEIR MOTHERS WERE OFF AT WORK
3242-67168-0008 OF COURSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT TO GET OUR PASTOR OR THE POLICE AFTER ME SO I TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD SHE WENT OFF HAPPY BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER SHE DROPPED IN AGAIN LOOKING SORT OF DISSATISFIED TO FIND OUT IF I WOULDN'T BUILD THE CRECHE ITSELF
3242-67168-0009 IT SEEMED LIKE A WORTHY OBJECT SO I SENT SOME CARPENTERS OVER TO KNOCK TOGETHER A LONG FRAME PAVILION SHE WAS MIGHTY GRATEFUL YOU BET AND I DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR A FORTNIGHT THEN SHE CALLED BY TO SAY THAT SO LONG AS I WAS IN THE BUSINESS AND THEY DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING SPECIAL
3242-67168-0010 WOULD I MIND GIVING HER A FEW COWS SHE HAD A SURPRISED AND GRIEVED EXPRESSION ON HER FACE AS SHE TALKED AND THE WAY SHE PUT IT MADE ME FEEL THAT I OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING THOUGHT OF THE LIVE STOCK MYSELF SO I THREW IN HALF A DOZEN COWS TO PROVIDE THE REFRESHMENTS
3242-67168-0011 TO ASK WHY I HADN'T HAD IT PAINTED I WAS TOO BUSY THAT MORNING TO QUARREL SO I SENT WORD THAT I WOULD FIX IT UP AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING BY THERE NEXT DAY THE PAINTERS WERE HARD AT WORK ON IT
3242-67168-0012 GRAHAM'S EXTRACT IT MAKES THE WEAK STRONG
3242-67168-0013 WENT ALL AROUND TOWN SAYING THAT I HAD GIVEN A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR SHED TO CHARITY AND PAINTED A THOUSAND DOLLAR AD ON IT ALLOWED I OUGHT TO SEND MY CHECK FOR THAT AMOUNT TO THE CRECHE FUND KEPT AT IT TILL I BEGAN TO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT AFTER ALL AND SENT HER THE MONEY
3242-67168-0014 THEN I FOUND A FELLOW WHO WANTED TO BUILD IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SOLD HIM THE LOT CHEAP AND GOT OUT OF THE CRECHE INDUSTRY
3242-67168-0015 BUT THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER PUT INTO IT WHICH DIDN'T DRAW DIVIDENDS IN FUN OR DOLLARS WAS WORRY THAT IS A BRANCH OF THE TRADE WHICH YOU WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR COMPETITORS I'VE ALWAYS FOUND WORRYING A BLAMED SIGHT MORE UNCERTAIN THAN HORSE RACING IT'S HARDER TO PICK A WINNER AT IT
3242-67168-0016 YOU GO HOME WORRYING BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT YOUR FOOL NEW CLERK FORGOT TO LOCK THE SAFE AFTER YOU AND DURING THE NIGHT THE LARD REFINERY BURNS DOWN YOU SPEND A YEAR FRETTING BECAUSE YOU THINK BILL JONES IS GOING TO CUT YOU OUT WITH YOUR BEST GIRL AND THEN YOU SPEND TEN WORRYING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
3242-67168-0017 A BUSY MAN HAS NO TIME TO BOTHER WITH IT HE CAN ALWAYS FIND PLENTY OF OLD WOMEN IN SKIRTS OR TROUSERS TO SPEND THEIR DAYS WORRYING OVER THEIR OWN TROUBLES AND TO SIT UP NIGHTS WAKING HIS SPEAKING OF HANDING OVER YOUR WORRIES TO OTHERS NATURALLY CALLS TO MIND THE WIDOW WILLIAMS AND HER SON BUD
3242-67168-0018 WHO WAS A PLAYMATE OF MINE WHEN I WAS A BOY BUD WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE WIDOW'S TROUBLES AND SHE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE TROUBLES SELDOM CAME SINGLY HAD FOURTEEN ALTOGETHER AND FOUR PAIR OF EM WERE TWINS
3242-67168-0019 AND THEN SHE'D SHED ALL WORRY OVER THEM FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALLOWED THAT IF THEY GOT HURT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BRING THEM HOME
3242-67168-0020 AND SOMEWAYS THE WHOLE DROVE ALWAYS SHOWED UP SAFE AND DIRTY ABOUT MEAL TIME
3242-67168-0021 AND SO WHEN BUD'S CLOTHES WERE FOUND AT THE SWIMMING HOLE ONE DAY AND NO BUD INSIDE THEM SHE DIDN'T TAKE ON UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD BROUGHT THE NEWS AND WHO WERE STANDING AROUND WAITING FOR HER TO GO OFF INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE WAY OF HIGH STRIKES
3242-67168-0022 HINTED THAT THERE'D BE NO FUNERAL OR SUCH LIKE EXPENSIVE GOINGS ON UNTIL SOME ONE PRODUCED THE DECEASED TAKE HER BY AND LARGE SHE WAS A PRETTY COOL CALM CUCUMBER
3242-67168-0023 AND EVERY ONE JUST QUIT WORK TO TELL EACH OTHER WHAT A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW HE WAS AND HOW HIS MOTHER HADN'T DESERVED TO HAVE SUCH A BRIGHT LITTLE SUNBEAM IN HER HOME AND TO DRAG THE RIVER BETWEEN TALKS BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A RISE
3242-67168-0024 BUT FINALLY AT THE END OF A WEEK WHEN THEY'D STRAINED THE WHOLE RIVER THROUGH THEIR DRAGS AND HADN'T ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT A COLLECTION OF TIN CANS AND DEAD CATFISH
3242-67168-0025 AND WENT DOWN THE STREET TO THE CABIN OF LOUISIANA CLYTEMNESTRA AN OLD YELLOW WOMAN WHO WOULD GO INTO A TRANCE FOR FOUR BITS AND FIND A FORTUNE FOR YOU FOR A DOLLAR I RECKON SHE'D HAVE CALLED HERSELF A CLAIRVOYANT NOWADAYS BUT THEN SHE WAS JUST A VOODOO WOMAN
3242-67168-0026 WELL THE WIDOW SAID SHE RECKONED THAT BOYS OUGHT TO BE LET OUT AS WELL AS IN FOR HALF PRICE AND SO SHE LAID DOWN TWO BITS ALLOWING THAT SHE WANTED A FEW MINUTES PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER BUD
3242-67168-0027 CLYTIE SAID SHE'D DO HER BEST BUT THAT SPIRITS WERE MIGHTY SNIFTY AND HIGH TONED EVEN WHEN THEY'D ONLY BEEN POOR WHITE TRASH ON EARTH AND IT MIGHT MAKE THEM MAD TO BE CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR HIGH JINKS IF THEY WERE TAKING A LITTLE RECREATION OR FROM THEIR HIGH PRICED NEW YORK CUSTOMERS IF THEY WERE WORKING
3242-67168-0028 BUT NEXT DAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND PAID DOWN FOUR BITS AND CLYTIE RECKONED THAT THAT OUGHT TO FETCH BUD SURE SOMEWAYS THOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY LUCK AND FINALLY THE WIDOW SUGGESTED THAT SHE CALL UP BUD'S FATHER BUCK WILLIAMS HAD BEEN DEAD A MATTER OF TEN YEARS
3242-67168-0029 AND THE OLD MAN RESPONDED PROMPTLY WHERE'S BUD ASKED THE WIDOW
3242-67168-0030 NO THEN HE'D HAVE TO LOOK DOWNSTAIRS FOR HIM CLYTIE TOLD THE WIDOW TO CALL AGAIN AND THEY'D GET HIM SURE SO SHE CAME BACK NEXT DAY AND LAID DOWN A DOLLAR THAT FETCHED OLD BUCK WILLIAMS GHOST ON THE JUMP YOU BET
3242-67168-0031 BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A WHISPER EVEN FROM BUD I RECKON CLYTIE HAD BEEN STRINGING THE OLD LADY ALONG INTENDING TO PRODUCE BUD'S SPOOK AS A SORT OF RED FIRE CALCIUM LIGHT GRAND MARCH OF THE AMAZONS CLIMAX BUT SHE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
3242-67168-0032 FOR RIGHT THERE THE OLD LADY GOT UP WITH A MIGHTY SET EXPRESSION AROUND HER LIPS AND MARCHED OUT MUTTERING THAT IT WAS JUST AS SHE HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG BUD WASN'T THERE AND WHEN THE NEIGHBORS DROPPED IN THAT AFTERNOON TO PLAN OUT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HER LOST LAMB
3242-67168-0033 SHE CHASED THEM OFF THE LOT WITH A BROOM
3242-67168-0034 AND THAT THEY WOULD JUST STAND PAT NOW AND WAIT FOR HIM TO MAKE THE NEXT MOVE
3242-67168-0035 BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE TILL THEN ALTOGETHER IT LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS A HEAP OF TROUBLE COMING TO BUD IF HE HAD MADE ANY MISTAKE AND WAS STILL ALIVE THE WIDOW FOUND HER LOST LAMB HIDING BEHIND A RAIN BARREL WHEN SHE OPENED UP THE HOUSE NEXT MORNING
3242-67168-0036 AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY TOUCHING AND AFFECTING SCENE IN FACT THE WIDOW MUST HAVE TOUCHED HIM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES AND EVERY TIME HE WAS AFFECTED TO TEARS FOR SHE WAS USING A BED SLAT WHICH IS A POWERFULLY STRONG MORAL AGENT FOR MAKING A BOY SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS
3242-67168-0037 AND IT WAS A MONTH AFTER THAT BEFORE BUD COULD GO DOWN MAIN STREET WITHOUT SOME MAN WHO HAD CALLED HIM A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW OR A BRIGHT MANLY LITTLE CHAP WHILE HE WAS DROWNED REACHING OUT AND FETCHING HIM A CLIP ON THE EAR FOR HAVING COME BACK AND PUT THE LAUGH ON HIM
3242-67168-0038 BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
3242-67168-0039 I SAIL FOR HOME TO MORROW
