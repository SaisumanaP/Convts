8123-275216-0000 TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
8123-275216-0001 WE ARE ALL OAK TREES THEY SAID WE OWN THE LAND AND RULE OVER IT AND THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS
8123-275216-0002 THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
8123-275216-0003 ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
8123-275216-0004 SAID THE BEAR LICKING HIS PAWS THAT IS ALL THE SHADE YOU CAN GIVE AGAINST THE SUN IF YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH ME YOU CAN GO ANSWERED THE OAK PROUDLY

8123-275216-0007 BUT I DON'T WANT TO CHATTER ANY MORE WITH YOU JUST NOW I HAVE HAD TO TROT A MILE ON ACCOUNT OF A CONFOUNDED HUNTER WHO STRUCK ME ON ONE OF MY HIND LEGS WITH AN ARROW NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SLEEP
8123-275216-0008 AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME AT PEACE SINCE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME SHADE THE BEAR STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT AND CLOSED HIS EYES BUT HE GOT NO SLEEP THAT TIME FOR THE OTHER TREES HAD HEARD HIS STORY
8123-275216-0009 WHAT KIND OF TREES CAN THEY BE WHOSE LEAVES SIT SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP BETWEEN THEM ASKED A LITTLE OAK WHO WAS LISTENING TO WHAT THE BIG ONES WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT BY HIS SIDE STOOD AN OLD GNARLED TREE
8123-275216-0010 WHO GAVE THE LITTLE OAK A CLOUT ON THE HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS LOWEST BOUGHS HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SAID AND DON'T TALK TILL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NEED NONE OF YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THE BEAR'S NONSENSE
8123-275216-0011 I WILL BRING SOME BEECH NUTS WITH ME AND I VOW YOU WILL ALL TURN YELLOW WITH JEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEE HOW PRETTY THE NEW TREES ARE THEN HE MADE OFF BUT THE OAKS TALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG ONE TO ANOTHER ABOUT THE FUNNY TREES HE HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT
8123-275216-0012 IF THEY COME I WILL KILL THEM SAID THE LITTLE OAK TREE BUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS HE GOT ONE ON THE HEAD FROM THE OLD OAK IF THEY COME YOU SHALL TREAT THEM POLITELY YOU YOUNG DOG SAID HE BUT THEY WILL NOT COME
8123-275216-0013 BUT IN THIS THE OLD OAK WAS WRONG FOR THEY DID COME TOWARDS AUTUMN THE BEAR CAME BACK AND LAY DOWN UNDER THE OLD OAK MY FRIENDS DOWN THERE WISH ME TO PRESENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS HE SAID

8123-275216-0016 THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
8123-275216-0017 THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
8123-275216-0018 AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
8123-275216-0019 THE SUN SHONE ON THEM AND THE RAIN FELL ON THEM SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY GREW TALL OH HOW PRETTY THEY ARE SAID THE GREAT OAK AND STOOPED HIS CROOKED BOUGHS STILL MORE SO THAT THEY COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THEM
8123-275216-0020 YOU ARE WELCOME AMONG US SAID THE OLD OAK AND GRACIOUSLY INCLINED HIS HEAD TO THEM YOU SHALL BE MY FOSTER CHILDREN AND BE TREATED JUST AS WELL AS MY OWN THANKS SAID THE LITTLE BEECHES
8123-275216-0021 AND THEY SAID NO MORE BUT THE LITTLE OAK COULD NOT BEAR THE STRANGE TREES IT IS DREADFUL THE WAY YOU SHOOT UP INTO THE AIR HE SAID IN VEXATION YOU ARE ALREADY HALF AS TALL AS I AM BUT I BEG YOU TO TAKE NOTICE THAT I AM MUCH OLDER
8123-275216-0022 AND OF GOOD FAMILY BESIDES THE BEECHES LAUGHED WITH THEIR LITTLE TINY GREEN LEAVES BUT SAID NOTHING SHALL I BEND MY BRANCHES A LITTLE ASIDE SO THAT THE SUN CAN SHINE BETTER ON YOU THE OLD TREE ASKED POLITELY

8123-275216-0025 THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
8123-275216-0026 A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
8123-275216-0027 YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING
8123-275216-0028 HOW WILL YOU BE ABLE TO HOLD OUT WHEN A REGULAR STORM COMES I ASSURE YOU THE WIND GIVES ONE'S HEAD A GOOD SHAKING MY OLD BOUGHS HAVE CREAKED MANY A TIME AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BECOME OF THE FLIMSY FINERY THAT YOU STICK UP IN THE AIR
8123-275216-0029 EVERY ONE HAS HIS OWN MANNER OF GROWTH AND WE HAVE OURS ANSWERED THE YOUNG BEECHES THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE WHERE WE COME FROM AND WE ARE PERHAPS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0031 BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8123-275216-0032 EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
8123-275216-0033 THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
8123-275216-0034 AND SHELTERED YOU AGAINST THE STORM I LET THE SUN SHINE ON YOU AS MUCH AS EVER HE WOULD AND I TREATED YOU AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN CHILDREN AND IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS YOU STIFLE ME STUFF AND NONSENSE
8123-275216-0035 SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
8123-275216-0036 AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
8123-275216-0037 AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
8123-275216-0038 ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
8123-275216-0039 BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
8123-275216-0040 THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
8123-275216-0041 AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
8123-275216-0042 BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
8123-275216-0043 AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
