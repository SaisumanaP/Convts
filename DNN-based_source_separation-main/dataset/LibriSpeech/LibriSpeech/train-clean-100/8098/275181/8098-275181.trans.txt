8098-275181-0000 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0002 AND MYSELF WERE IN THE TURKEY BUSINESS EQUAL PARTNERS WE OWNED A FLOCK OF THIRTY ONE TURKEYS THESE ROOSTED BY NIGHT IN A LARGE BUTTERNUT TREE IN FRONT OF TOM'S HOUSE IN THE VERY TOP OF IT
8098-275181-0003 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0004 THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
8098-275181-0005 TOM THOUGHT IT WAS THE TWOMBLY BOYS NEFARIOUS SAM IN PARTICULAR I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OWL BUT UNDER THE TREE IN THE SOFT DIRT WHERE THE POTATOES HAD RECENTLY BEEN DUG WE FOUND FOX TRACKS
8098-275181-0006 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0007 AND A CASUALTY SUCH AS TURKEY RAISERS ARE UNAVOIDABLY HEIRS TO AND WE BORE OUR LOSS WITH RESIGNATION WE WERE GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT TURKEYS DID NOT OFTEN FALL OFF THEIR ROOSTS
8098-275181-0008 THIS THEORY RECEIVED SOMETHING OF A CHECK WHEN OUR FLOCK COUNTED ONLY TWENTY NINE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MORE FOX TRACKS AND A GREAT MANY MORE FEATHERS UNDER THE TREE THIS PUT A NEW AND ALTOGETHER UGLY ASPECT ON THE MATTER
8098-275181-0009 NO ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO FIGURE THE OUTCOME OF THE TURKEY BUSINESS AT THIS RATE TOGETHER WITH OUR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW FACT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AT ONCE TOO
8098-275181-0010 OR RUIN WOULD SWALLOW UP THE POULTRY FIRM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY WE ATTRIBUTED THE MISCHIEF TO A CERTAIN SILVER GRAY THAT HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AUTUMN
8098-275181-0011 IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO MUCH SPACE TO RELATE IN DETAIL THE PLANS WE LAID AND PUT IN EXECUTION TO CATCH THAT FOX DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS I RECOLLECT THAT WE SET THREE TRAPS FOR HIM TO NO PURPOSE
8098-275181-0012 HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TWO MORE OF THE TURKEYS HEROES IT IS SAID ARE BORN OF GREAT CRISES THIS DILEMMA OF OURS DEVELOPED TOM'S GENIUS I'LL HAVE THAT FOX HE SAID WHEN THE TRAPS FAILED
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0014 THEY SAVORED AS STRONGLY OF MICE AS TOM'S QUESTION OF BAD GRAMMAR AND DON'T FOXES CATCH MICE DEMANDED TOM CONFIDENTLY YES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH THE FOX I SAID
8098-275181-0015 WELL LOOK HERE THEN I'LL SHOW YE SAID HE
8098-275181-0016 AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
8098-275181-0017 AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
8098-275181-0018 INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
8098-275181-0019 AS I HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT FOXES DID WHEN MOUSING INSTANTLY TWO SPRY BROWN HANDS FROM OUT THE NEST CLUTCHED ME WITH A MOST VENGEFUL GRIP AS A FOX I STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY
8098-275181-0020 THEN IN DUMB SHOW KNOCKED MY HEAD WITH A STONE D'YE SEE NOW HE DEMANDED I SAW BUT A FOX WOULD BITE YOU I OBJECTED LET HIM BITE SAID TOM
8098-275181-0021 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-275181-0023 MADE BY SUCKING THE AIR SHARPLY BETWIXT HIS TEETH NOW BE OFF SAID TOM AND DON'T COME POKING AROUND NOR GET IN SIGHT TILL YOU HEAR ME HOLLER
8098-275181-0024 AND BEING AMIDST NICE COZY STRAW I PRESENTLY WENT TO SLEEP QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY I MUST HAVE SLEPT SOME TIME THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME BUT A VERY FEW MINUTES WHAT WOKE ME WAS A NOISE A SHARP SUPPRESSED YELP
8098-275181-0025 IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
8098-275181-0026 AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-275181-0028 AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM THAT NIGHT WE TOOK THE FOX TO THE HOUSE AND LIGHTED A CANDLE IT WAS THE SILVER GRAY TOM WASHED HIS BITE IN COLD WATER AND WENT TO BED
8098-275181-0029 HIS LEFT HAND WAS BITTEN THROUGH THE PALM AND BADLY SWOLLEN THERE WAS ALSO A DEEP BITE IN THE FLESHY PART OF HIS RIGHT ARM JUST BELOW THE ELBOW SEVERAL MINOR NIPS IN HIS LEFT LEG ABOVE THE KNEE AND A RAGGED GRAB
8098-275181-0030 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL
8098-275181-0032 I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER CARED TO MAKE A FOX TRAP OF HIMSELF AGAIN HOWEVER WE SOLD THE FOX SKIN IN THE VILLAGE AND RECEIVED THIRTEEN DOLLARS FOR IT WHEREAS A COMMON RED FOX SKIN IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS
8098-275181-0033 HOW OR BY WHAT WILES THAT FOX GOT THE TURKEYS OUT OF THE HIGH BUTTERNUT IS A SECRET
