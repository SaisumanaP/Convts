5104-33407-0012 HE WAS KEEN EYED AND SOON SAW LEIF IN HIS FAR SEAT YONDER IS SOME MAN OF MARK HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE IS SURELY WORTH KNOWING HIS FACE IS NOT THE FACE OF A FOOL
5104-33407-0013 HE CARRIES HIS HEAD LIKE A LORD OF MEN HE SENT A THRALL AND ASKED LEIF TO COME TO HIM SO LEIF WALKED DOWN THE LONG HALL AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU FOR A GUEST THE KING SAID

5104-33407-0020 SO HE STEERED FOR IT AS THEY CAME NEAR THE MEN SAID SEE THE GREAT TREES AND THE SOFT GREEN SHORE SURELY THIS IS A BETTER COUNTRY THAN GREENLAND OR THAN ICELAND EITHER
5104-33407-0021 WHEN THEY LANDED THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND I NEVER LAY ON A BED SO SOFT AS THIS GRASS ONE SAID TALLER TREES DO NOT GROW IN NORWAY SAID ANOTHER
5104-33407-0022 THERE IS NO STONE HERE AS IN NORWAY BUT ONLY GOOD BLACK DIRT LEIF SAID I NEVER SAW SO FERTILE A LAND BEFORE THE MEN WERE HUNGRY AND SET ABOUT BUILDING A FIRE THERE IS NO LACK OF FUEL HERE
5104-33407-0023 THEY SAID THEY STAYED MANY DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WALKED ABOUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE A GERMAN NAMED TYRKER WAS WITH LEIF HE WAS A LITTLE MAN WITH A HIGH FOREHEAD AND A SHORT NOSE HIS EYES WERE BIG AND ROLLING
5104-33407-0024 HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
5104-33407-0025 WHERE IS TYRKER NO ONE KNEW THEN LEIF WAS ANGRY IS A MAN OF SO LITTLE VALUE IN THIS EMPTY LAND THAT YOU WOULD LOSE ONE HE SAID WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP TOGETHER DID YOU NOT SEE THAT HE WAS GONE
5104-33407-0026 WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
5104-33407-0027 AGAIN LEIF ASKED HIS QUESTION AND PUT HIS HAND ON TYRKER'S SHOULDER AS THOUGH HE WOULD SHAKE HIM THEN TYRKER ANSWERED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ICELAND I HAVE NOT BEEN SO VERY FAR BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WONDERFUL WHAT IS IT
5104-33407-0028 CRIED THE MEN I HAVE FOUND GRAPES GROWING WILD ANSWERED TYRKER AND HE LAUGHED AND HIS EYES SHONE IT CANNOT BE LEIF SAID GRAPES DO NOT GROW IN GREENLAND NOR IN ICELAND NOR EVEN IN NORWAY
5104-33407-0029 SO IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING TO THESE NORSEMEN CAN I NOT TELL GRAPES WHEN I SEE THEM CRIED TYRKER DID I NOT GROW UP IN GERMANY WHERE EVERY HILLSIDE IS COVERED WITH GRAPEVINES AH IT SEEMS LIKE MY OLD HOME
5104-33407-0030 IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
5104-33407-0031 THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
5104-33407-0032 WE WILL FILL THE ROWBOAT WITH GRAPES AND TOW IT BEHIND US THE SHIP WE WILL LOAD WITH LOGS FROM THESE GREAT TREES THAT WILL BE A WELCOME SHIPLOAD IN GREENLAND WHERE WE HAVE NEITHER TREES NOR VINES
5104-33407-0033 NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
5104-33407-0034 AS THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE LEIF SAID I WILL CALL THIS COUNTRY WINELAND FOR THE GRAPES THAT GROW THERE ONE OF THE MEN LEAPED UPON THE GUNWALE AND LEANED OUT CLINGING TO THE SAIL AND SANG
5104-33407-0035 WINELAND THE GREEN THE GREAT THE FAT OUR DRAGON FED AND CRAWLS AWAY WITH BELLY STUFFED AND LAZY FEET HOW LONG HER PURPLE TRAILING TAIL SHE FED AND GREW TO TWICE HER SIZE
5104-33407-0036 THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
5104-33407-0037 ERIC SAW THE SHIP AND RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE HE TOOK LEIF INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID OH MY SON MY OLD EYES ACHED TO SEE YOU I HUNGER TO HEAR OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE

5104-33407-0043 THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
5104-33407-0044 WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
5104-33407-0045 AND THORBIORN HIMSELF WAS RICH WHEN OUR FATHER KNEW HIM AND WAS MUCH HONORED BY ALL MEN BUT ILL LUCK CAME AND HE GREW POOR THIS HURT HIS PRIDE I WILL NOT STAY IN ICELAND AND BE A BEGGAR
5104-33407-0046 HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT HAVE MEN LOOK AT ME AND SAY HE IS NOT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS I WILL GO TO MY FRIEND ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND THEN HE GOT READY A GREAT FEAST AND INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS
5104-33407-0047 IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST
