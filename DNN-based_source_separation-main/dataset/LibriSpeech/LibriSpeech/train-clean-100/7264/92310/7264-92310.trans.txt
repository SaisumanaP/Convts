7264-92310-0000 LET US HALT AT THIS PHASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THING TO CONSIDER CERTAIN OTHER CHANGES WHICH WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE AND WHY THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ADVERTISEMENT HAD COME TO BE THE STAND BY OF A NEWSPAPER
7264-92310-0001 THE CAPITALIST OWNING THE SHEET WOULD NECESSARILY CONSIDER HIS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HE WAS INDEED COMPELLED TO DO SO UNLESS HE HAD ENORMOUS REVENUES FROM OTHER SOURCES AND RAN HIS PAPER AS A LUXURY COSTING A VAST FORTUNE A YEAR
7264-92310-0002 FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY THE RULE IS EITHER VERY GREAT PROFITS OR VERY GREAT AND RAPID LOSSES
7264-92310-0003 WHERE A GREAT DAILY PAPER IS CONCERNED HE WAS COMPELLED THEN TO RESPECT HIS ADVERTISERS AS HIS PAYMASTERS TO THAT EXTENT THEREFORE HIS POWER OF GIVING TRUE NEWS AND OF PRINTING SOUND OPINION WAS LIMITED EVEN THOUGH HIS OWN INCLINATIONS SHOULD LEAN TOWARDS SUCH NEWS AND SUCH OPINION
7264-92310-0004 AN INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER OWNER MIGHT FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DISLIKE FOR THE TRADE IN PATENT MEDICINES HE MIGHT OBJECT TO THE SWINDLING OF THE POOR WHICH IS THE SOUL OF THAT TRADE HE MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE SUFFERED ACUTE PHYSICAL PAIN
7264-92310-0005 BUT HE CERTAINLY COULD NOT PRINT AN ARTICLE AGAINST THEM NOR EVEN AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING HOW THEY WERE MADE WITHOUT LOSING A GREAT PART OF HIS INCOME DIRECTLY AND PERHAPS INDIRECTLY THE WHOLE OF IT FROM THE ANNOYANCE CAUSED TO OTHER ADVERTISERS WHO WOULD NOTE HIS INDEPENDENCE
7264-92310-0006 AND FEAR FRICTION IN THEIR OWN CASE HE WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN HIS INCOME PERSUADE HIS READERS TO BUY POISON AND REMAIN FREE PERSONALLY FROM TOUCHING THE STUFF HE RECOMMENDED FOR PAY
7264-92310-0007 THE PROPRIETOR WAS ALWAYS AT THE CHOICE OF PUBLISHING MATTER WHICH DID NOT AFFECT HIM AND SAVING HIS FORTUNE OR REFUSING IT AND JEOPARDIZING HIS FORTUNE HE CHOSE THE FORMER COURSE IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE WAS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ADVERTISEMENT
7264-92310-0008 HAVING BECOME THE STAND BY OF THE NEWSPAPER THE LARGE ADVERTISER
7264-92310-0009 COULD NOT BUT REGARD HIS GIVING OF AN ADVERTISEMENT AS SOMETHING OF A FAVOUR THERE IS ALWAYS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL OR IF YOU WILL ARTISTIC ELEMENT IN EXCHANGE IN PURE ECONOMICS EXCHANGE IS EXACTLY BALANCED BY THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE EXCHANGERS
7264-92310-0010 JUST AS IN PURE DYNAMICS YOU HAVE THE PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES IN THE IMMENSE COMPLEXITY OF THE REAL WORLD MATERIAL FRICTION AND A MILLION OTHER THINGS AFFECT THE IDEAL PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES AND IN ECONOMICS OTHER CONSCIOUS PASSIONS
7264-92310-0011 BESIDES THOSE OF MERE AVARICE AFFECT EXCHANGE THERE ARE A MILLION HALF CONSCIOUS AND SUB CONSCIOUS MOTIVES AT WORK AS WELL THE LARGE ADVERTISER STILL MAINLY PAID FOR ADVERTISEMENT ACCORDING TO CIRCULATION
7264-92310-0012 HE WOULD NOT ADVERTISE IN PAPERS WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BY THEIR PUBLICATION OF OPINION ULTIMATELY HURT CAPITALISM AS A WHOLE STILL LESS IN THOSE WHOSE OPINIONS MIGHT AFFECT HIS OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE ADVERSELY STUPID LIKE ALL PEOPLE GIVEN UP TO GAIN
7264-92310-0013 HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
7264-92310-0014 OR SOME SUCH PLACE THAT THE PAPER WAS IN BAD TASTE NOT ONLY WAS THERE THIS NEGATIVE POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE ADVERTISER THAT OF REFUSING THE FAVOUR OR PATRONAGE OF HIS ADVERTISEMENTS THERE WAS ALSO A POSITIVE ONE THOUGH THAT ONLY GREW UP LATER
7264-92310-0015 THE ADVERTISER CAME TO SEE THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY DICTATE POLICY AND OPINION AND THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER MOST POWERFUL AND NOVEL WEAPON IN HIS HAND WHICH WAS THE SUPPRESSION OF NEWS
7264-92310-0016 WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THIS ELEMENT FOR ONE THING THE POWER REPRESENTED BY THE GREAT CAPITALIST PRESS WAS A POWER EQUAL WITH THAT OF THE GREAT ADVERTISERS FOR ANOTHER THERE WAS NO CLEAR CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CAPITALISM THAT OWNED NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITALISM THAT ADVERTISED
7264-92310-0017 THE SAME MAN WHO OWNED THE DAILY TIMES WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN JONES'S SOAP OR SMITH'S PILLS THE MAN WHO GAMBLED AND LOST ON THE HOWL WAS AT THE SAME TIME GAMBLING AND WINNING ON A BUCKET SHOP ADVERTISED IN THE HOWL
7264-92310-0018 THERE WAS NO ANTAGONISM OF CLASS INTEREST ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND WHAT WAS MORE THEY WERE OF THE SAME KIND AND BREED
7264-92310-0019 WAS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF MAN AS HE WHO BOUGHT A PEERAGE OUT OF A COMBINE IN MUSIC HALLS OR CUT HIS THROAT WHEN HIS BLUFF IN INDIAN SILVER WAS CALLED THE TYPE IS THE COMMON MODERN TYPE PARLIAMENT IS FULL OF IT AND IT RUNS NEWSPAPERS ONLY AS ONE OF ITS ACTIVITIES
7264-92310-0020 ALL OF WHICH NEED THE SUGGESTION OF ADVERTISEMENT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER AND THE ADVERTISER THEN WERE INTERMIXED BUT ON THE BALANCE THE ADVERTISING INTEREST BEING WIDER SPREAD WAS THE STRONGER AND WHAT YOU GOT WAS A SORT OF IMPOSITION
7264-92310-0021 OFTEN QUITE CONSCIOUS AND DIRECT OF ADVERTISING POWER OVER THE PRESS AND THIS WAS AS I HAVE SAID NOT ONLY NEGATIVE THAT WAS LONG OBVIOUS BUT AT LAST POSITIVE
7264-92310-0022 BOTH COMBATANTS ARE OF A LOW CUNNING AND UNINTELLIGENT TYPE MINOR FRICTION DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE SOMETIMES THE VICTORY FALLS TO THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR MORE OFTEN TO THE ADVERTISER NEVER TO THE PUBLIC
7264-92310-0023 SO FAR WE SEE THE GROWTH OF THE PRESS MARKED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ONE IT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A VERY FEW RICH MEN AND NEARLY ALWAYS OF MEN OF BASE ORIGIN AND CAPACITIES TWO IT IS IN THEIR HANDS A MERE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
7264-92310-0024 THREE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISERS WHO CAN IN PART CONTROL IT BUT THESE ARE OF THE SAME CAPITALIST KIND IN MOTIVE AND MANNER WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PAPERS THEIR POWER DOES NOT THEREFORE CLASH IN THE MAIN WITH THAT OF THE OWNERS
7264-92310-0025 BUT THE FACT THAT ADVERTISEMENT MAKES A PAPER HAS CREATED A STANDARD OF PRINTING AND PAPER SUCH THAT NO ONE SAVE AT A DISASTROUS LOSS CAN ISSUE REGULARLY TO LARGE NUMBERS NEWS AND OPINION WHICH THE LARGE CAPITALIST ADVERTISERS DISAPPROVE
7264-92310-0026 THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE FOR ANY INDEPENDENT PRESS NO POSSIBLE ECONOMIC BASIS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO EXPECT FOR
7264-92310-0027 THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
7264-92310-0028 IT IS THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNER AS THE TRUE GOVERNING POWER IN THE POLITICAL MACHINERY OF THE STATE SUPERIOR TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE STATE NOMINATING MINISTERS AND DISMISSING THEM IMPOSING POLICIES AND IN GENERAL USURPING SOVEREIGNTY
7264-92310-0029 ALL THIS SECRETLY AND WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY IT IS THE CHIEF POLITICAL EVENT OF OUR TIME AND IS THE PECULIAR MARK OF THIS COUNTRY TO DAY ITS FULL DEVELOPMENT HAS COME ON US SUDDENLY AND TAKEN US BY SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF A TERRIBLE WAR
7264-92310-0030 IT WAS UNDREAMT OF BUT A FEW YEARS AGO IT IS ALREADY TO DAY THE CAPITAL FACT OF OUR WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM A PRIME MINISTER IS MADE OR DEPOSED BY THE OWNER OF A GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS NOT BY POPULAR VOTE OR BY ANY OTHER FORM OF OPEN AUTHORITY
7264-92310-0031 NO POLICY IS ATTEMPTED UNTIL IT IS ASCERTAINED THAT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER IS IN FAVOUR OF IT FEW ARE PROFFERED WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING HIS WISHES MANY ARE DIRECTLY ORDERED BY HIM WE ARE IF WE TALK IN TERMS OF REAL THINGS AS MEN DO IN THEIR PRIVATE COUNCILS AT WESTMINSTER
7264-92310-0032 MAINLY GOVERNED TO DAY NOT EVEN BY THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS NOR EVEN BY THOSE WHO PAY THEM MONEY BUT BY WHATEVER OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER TRUST IS FOR THE MOMENT THE MOST UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE MOST AMBITIOUS
