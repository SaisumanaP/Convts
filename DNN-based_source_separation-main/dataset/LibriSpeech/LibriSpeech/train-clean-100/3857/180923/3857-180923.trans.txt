3857-180923-0003 OR THAN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE SAME SERVICE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED YET TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SUCH EXPERIENCES AS HAVE BEEN RECOUNTED WHICH BECAME FOR THEM FOR A TIME THE COMMONPLACES OF EVERY DAY LIFE
3857-180923-0004 IS ENOUGH TO PLACE THEM APART FROM ORDINARY MEN IN THE EYES OF OUR PEACE KNOWING GENERATION IN FACT TO HAVE PASSED THE TESTS OF SO FIERCE A COURSE OF EDUCATION GIVES THEM A TITLE TO A PLACE THUS APART THE UNIVERSITY MAN OF TO DAY
3857-180923-0005 AS THE BURDEN OF THE BACCALAUREATE SERMONS SO FREQUENTLY TESTIFIES IS CONSIGNED TO A SPECIAL PLACE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS TRAINING THESE MEN SURELY EARNED ONE OF SPECIAL HONOR BY REASON OF THEIRS WHICH WAS TOO

3857-180923-0020 THERE ARE NOT A FEW OTHER NAMES UPON THE ROLLS OF THE REGIMENT WHICH UPON MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT CASE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE LIST
3857-180923-0021 A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION WOULD ALSO GIVE A LARGE PLACE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF ITS VETERANS FORMED SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR WHOSE FREQUENT GATHERINGS HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL LIKENESS TO THE REUNIONS OF COLLEGE CLASSES

3857-180923-0025 THOUGH THE LARGE ADDITION TO ITS NUMBERS WHICH THE INCREASE IN SIZE NECESSITATED MADE IT PERHAPS SOMEWHAT LESS HOMOGENEOUS THAN AT FIRST IT DID NOT GREATLY ALTER ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
