441-128982-0000 WHEN THE LITTLE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ AND HIS MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CAMPEACHY THEY MET WITH VERY STORMY WEATHER SO THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THE SHIP WHICH CONTAINED BARTHOLEMY AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PORT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND
441-128982-0001 THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
441-128982-0002 FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
441-128982-0003 AND WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS VARIOUS EXPLOITS HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD ON BOARD ONE OF THE VERY WORST PIRATES IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOSE WICKED DEEDS WERE WELL KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WEST INDIES
441-128982-0004 AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
441-128982-0005 AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
441-128982-0006 WHEN THIS DIGNITARY HEARD THE STORY HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A PARTY OF OFFICERS TO THE SHIP AND COMMANDED THE CAPTAIN TO DELIVER THE PIRATE LEADER INTO THEIR CHARGE THE OTHER MEN WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE
441-128982-0007 BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
441-128982-0008 HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
441-128982-0009 AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
441-128982-0010 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
441-128982-0011 HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
441-128982-0012 THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
441-128982-0013 THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
441-128982-0014 FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
441-128982-0015 BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
441-128982-0016 AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
441-128982-0017 WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
441-128982-0018 AND WHERE THE WATER WHICH COVERED THE GROUND PREVENTED THE DOGS FROM FOLLOWING HIS SCENT HE HAD NOTHING TO EAT EXCEPT A FEW ROOTS OF WATER PLANTS BUT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PRIVATION AND THESE KEPT HIM ALIVE OFTEN HE HEARD THE HOUNDS BAYING ON THE DRY LAND ADJOINING THE MARSH
441-128982-0019 AND SOMETIMES HE SAW AT NIGHT DISTANT TORCHES WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE CARRIED BY MEN WHO WERE HUNTING FOR HIM BUT AT LAST THE PURSUIT SEEMED TO BE GIVEN UP AND HEARING NO MORE DOGS AND SEEING NO MORE FLICKERING LIGHTS BARTHOLEMY LEFT THE MARSH AND SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY DOWN THE COAST
441-128982-0020 WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
441-128982-0021 AND THIS SIGHT DOUBTLESS ANIMATED HIM VERY MUCH DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS JOURNEY THE TERRIBLE TRIALS AND HARDSHIPS WHICH BARTHOLEMY EXPERIENCED DURING HIS TRAMP ALONG THE COAST WERE SUCH AS COULD HAVE BEEN ENDURED ONLY BY ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND TOUGHEST OF MEN
441-128982-0022 BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
441-128982-0023 WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
441-128982-0024 ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
441-128982-0025 THE ANIMALS MIGHT HOWL AROUND HIM AND GLARE AT HIM WITH THEIR SHINING EYES AND THE ALLIGATORS MIGHT LASH THE WATER INTO FOAM WITH THEIR GREAT TAILS
441-128982-0026 THIS WAS A WIDE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH THE INLAND COUNTRY INTO THE SEA HE MADE HIS WAY UP THE SHORE OF THIS RIVER FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BUT IT GREW BUT LITTLE NARROWER AND HE COULD SEE NO CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS HE COULD NOT SWIM
441-128982-0027 AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
441-128982-0028 BUT A MAN IN HIS SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP READILY
441-128982-0029 NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
441-128982-0030 BARTHOLEMY PERCEIVED AN OLD BOARD IN WHICH THERE WERE SOME LONG AND HEAVY RUSTY NAILS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY THE INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELLER SET ABOUT A WORK WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO WANTED A NEEDLE
441-128982-0031 AND WHO BEGAN TO RUB A CROW BAR ON A STONE IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT TO THE PROPER SIZE BARTHOLEMY CAREFULLY KNOCKED ALL THE NAILS OUT OF THE BOARD AND THEN FINDING A LARGE FLAT STONE HE RUBBED DOWN ONE OF THEM UNTIL HE HAD FORMED IT INTO THE SHAPE OF A RUDE KNIFE BLADE
441-128982-0032 WHICH HE MADE AS SHARP AS HE COULD THEN WITH THESE TOOLS HE UNDERTOOK THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RAFT WORKING AWAY LIKE A BEAVER AND USING THE SHARPENED NAILS INSTEAD OF HIS TEETH
441-128982-0033 HE CUT DOWN A NUMBER OF SMALL TREES AND WHEN HE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE SLENDER TRUNKS HE BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH REEDS AND OSIERS WHICH HE FOUND ON THE RIVER BANK SO AFTER INFINITE LABOR AND TRIAL HE CONSTRUCTED A RAFT WHICH WOULD BEAR HIM ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
441-128982-0034 GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
441-128982-0035 EVEN IF HE COULD NOT WALK NO ATHLETE OF THE PRESENT DAY NO MATTER IF HE SHOULD BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED CIRCUS MAN COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO PERFORM THE FEAT WHICH THIS BOLD PIRATE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR FIVE OR SIX LEAGUES HE WENT THROUGH THAT MANGROVE FOREST
441-128982-0036 NEVER ONCE SETTING HIS FOOT UPON THE GROUND BY WHICH IS MEANT MUD WATER AND ROOTS BUT SWINGING HIMSELF BY HIS HANDS AND ARMS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AS IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT APE ONLY RESTING OCCASIONALLY DRAWING HIMSELF UPON A STOUT LIMB WHERE HE MIGHT SIT FOR A WHILE AND GET HIS BREATH
