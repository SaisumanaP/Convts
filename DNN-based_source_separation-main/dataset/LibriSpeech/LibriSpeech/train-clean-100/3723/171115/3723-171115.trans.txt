3723-171115-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE DEATH OF JOSEPH HEROD'S BROTHER WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNIFIED TO HEROD IN DREAMS HOW HEROD WAS PRESERVED TWICE AFTER A WONDERFUL MANNER HE CUTS OFF THE HEAD OF PAPPUS
3723-171115-0001 WHO WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS BROTHER AND SENDS THAT HEAD TO HIS OTHER BROTHER PHERORAS
3723-171115-0002 ONE IN THE MEAN TIME HEROD'S AFFAIRS IN JUDEA WERE IN AN ILL STATE HE HAD LEFT HIS BROTHER JOSEPH WITH FULL POWER BUT HAD CHARGED HIM TO MAKE NO ATTEMPTS AGAINST ANTIGONUS TILL HIS RETURN
3723-171115-0003 FOR THAT MACHAERUS WOULD NOT BE SUCH AN ASSISTANT AS HE COULD DEPEND ON AS IT APPEARED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE ALREADY
3723-171115-0004 AND MARCHED TOWARDS JERICHO WITH FIVE COHORTS WHICH MACHAERUS SENT WITH HIM
3723-171115-0005 FOR THESE COHORTS WERE NEW RAISED MEN GATHERED OUT OF SYRIA AND HERE WAS NO MIXTURE OF THOSE CALLED VETERAN SOLDIERS AMONG THEM WHO MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE THAT WERE UNSKILLFUL IN WAR TWO
3723-171115-0006 AND THERE DROWNED THEM THERE WAS A GREAT CHANGE MADE ALSO IN IDUMEA WHERE MACHAERUS WAS BUILDING A WALL ABOUT ONE OF THE FORTRESSES WHICH WAS CALLED GITTHA BUT HEROD HAD NOT YET BEEN INFORMED OF THESE THINGS
3723-171115-0007 TO ASSIST HEROD AND FOLLOWED HIMSELF SOON AFTER WITH THE REST OF HIS ARMY THREE NOW WHEN HEROD WAS AT DAPHNE BY ANTIOCH HE HAD SOME DREAMS WHICH CLEARLY FOREBODED HIS BROTHER'S DEATH
3723-171115-0008 AND AS HE LEAPED OUT OF HIS BED IN A DISTURBED MANNER THERE CAME MESSENGERS THAT ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THAT CALAMITY SO WHEN HE HAD LAMENTED THIS MISFORTUNE FOR A WHILE HE PUT OFF THE MAIN PART OF HIS MOURNING AND MADE HASTE TO MARCH AGAINST HIS ENEMIES
3723-171115-0009 HE MADE AN IRRUPTION INTO GALILEE AND MET HIS ENEMIES AND DROVE THEM BACK TO THE PLACE WHICH THEY HAD LEFT
3723-171115-0010 YET WAS HE FORCED BY A MOST TERRIBLE STORM TO PITCH HIS CAMP IN THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGES BEFORE HE COULD TAKE IT BUT WHEN AFTER A FEW DAYS TIME THE SECOND LEGION THAT CAME FROM ANTONY JOINED THEMSELVES TO HIM
3723-171115-0011 HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING VERY DEAR TO GOD FOR THAT EVENING THERE FEASTED WITH HIM MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN AND AFTER THAT FEAST WAS OVER AND ALL THE GUESTS WERE GONE OUT THE HOUSE FELL DOWN IMMEDIATELY
3723-171115-0012 AND BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH THOSE IN HIS FOREFRONT YET DURST THEY NOT BE SO VERY BOLD AS TO ENGAGE THE ROMANS HAND TO HAND BUT THREW STONES AND DARTS AT THEM AT A DISTANCE BY WHICH MEANS THEY WOUNDED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER
3723-171115-0013 IN WHICH ACTION HEROD'S OWN SIDE WAS WOUNDED WITH A DART FIVE NOW AS ANTIGONUS HAD A MIND TO APPEAR TO EXCEED HEROD NOT ONLY IN THE COURAGE BUT IN THE NUMBER OF HIS MEN HE SENT PAPPUS ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS WITH AN ARMY AGAINST SAMARIA
3723-171115-0014 BUT HEROD OVERRAN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND DEMOLISHED FIVE LITTLE CITIES AND DESTROYED TWO THOUSAND MEN THAT WERE IN THEM AND BURNED THEIR HOUSES AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS CAMP BUT HIS HEAD QUARTERS WERE AT THE VILLAGE CALLED CANA SIX
3723-171115-0015 NOW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF JEWS RESORTED TO HIM EVERY DAY BOTH OUT OF JERICHO AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME WERE MOVED SO TO DO OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO ANTIGONUS AND SOME OUT OF REGARD TO THE GLORIOUS ACTIONS HEROD HAD DONE
3723-171115-0016 BUT OTHERS WERE LED ON BY AN UNREASONABLE DESIRE OF CHANGE SO HE FELL UPON THEM IMMEDIATELY AS FOR PAPPUS AND HIS PARTY THEY WERE NOT TERRIFIED EITHER AT THEIR NUMBER OR AT THEIR ZEAL BUT MARCHED OUT WITH GREAT ALACRITY TO FIGHT THEM
3723-171115-0017 AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT NOW OTHER PARTS OF THEIR ARMY MADE RESISTANCE FOR A WHILE BUT HEROD RUNNING THE UTMOST HAZARD OUT OF THE RAGE HE WAS IN AT THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER THAT HE MIGHT BE AVENGED ON THOSE THAT HAD BEEN THE AUTHORS OF IT
3723-171115-0018 SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
3723-171115-0019 HE ALSO PRESSED HARD UPON THE HINDERMOST AND SLEW A VAST NUMBER OF THEM HE ALSO FELL INTO THE VILLAGE WITH THE ENEMY WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH ARMED MEN AND THE UPPER ROOMS WERE CROWDED ABOVE WITH SOLDIERS FOR THEIR DEFENSE
3723-171115-0020 AND WHEN HE HAD BEATEN THOSE THAT WERE ON THE OUTSIDE HE PULLED THE HOUSES TO PIECES AND PLUCKED OUT THOSE THAT WERE WITHIN UPON MANY HE HAD THE ROOFS SHAKEN DOWN WHEREBY THEY PERISHED BY HEAPS AND AS FOR THOSE THAT FLED OUT OF THE RUINS
3723-171115-0021 THAT THE CONQUERORS COULD NOT PASS ALONG THE ROADS NOW THE ENEMY COULD NOT BEAR THIS BLOW SO THAT WHEN THE MULTITUDE OF THEM WHICH WAS GATHERED TOGETHER SAW THAT THOSE IN THE VILLAGE WERE SLAIN THEY DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND FLED AWAY
3723-171115-0022 UPON THE CONFIDENCE OF WHICH VICTORY HEROD HAD MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO JERUSALEM
3723-171115-0023 NOW WHEN AT THE EVENING HEROD HAD ALREADY DISMISSED HIS FRIENDS TO REFRESH THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR FATIGUE AND WHEN HE WAS GONE HIMSELF WHILE HE WAS STILL HOT IN HIS ARMOR LIKE A COMMON SOLDIER TO BATHE HIMSELF
3723-171115-0024 ONE OF THE ENEMIES MET HIM IN THE FACE WITH A SWORD IN HIS HAND AND THEN A SECOND AND THEN A THIRD AND AFTER THAT MORE OF THEM THESE WERE MEN WHO HAD RUN AWAY OUT OF THE BATTLE INTO THE BATH IN THEIR ARMOR
3723-171115-0025 AND THEY HAD LAIN THERE FOR SOME TIME IN GREAT TERROR AND IN PRIVACY AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING THEY TREMBLED FOR FEAR AND RAN BY HIM IN A FLIGHT ALTHOUGH HE WAS NAKED AND ENDEAVORED TO GET OFF INTO THE PUBLIC ROAD
3723-171115-0026 NOW THERE WAS BY CHANCE NOBODY ELSE AT HAND THAT MIGHT SEIZE UPON THESE MEN AND FOR HEROD HE WAS CONTENTED TO HAVE COME TO NO HARM HIMSELF SO THAT THEY ALL GOT AWAY IN SAFETY EIGHT
3723-171115-0027 BUT ON THE NEXT DAY HEROD HAD PAPPUS'S HEAD CUT OFF WHO WAS THE GENERAL FOR ANTIGONUS AND WAS SLAIN IN THE BATTLE AND SENT IT TO HIS BROTHER PHERORAS BY WAY OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SLAIN BROTHER FOR HE WAS THE MAN THAT SLEW JOSEPH
3723-171115-0028 AND THERE IT WAS THAT POMPEY TOOK THE CITY SO HE PARTED THE WORK AMONG THE ARMY AND DEMOLISHED THE SUBURBS
3723-171115-0029 ACQUAINTANCE AT THE WORKS BUT HE WENT HIMSELF TO SAMARIA TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS TO WIFE WHO HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO HIM BEFORE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
3723-171115-0030 AND THUS HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY THE BY DURING THE SIEGE OF THE CITY FOR HE HAD HIS ENEMIES IN GREAT CONTEMPT ALREADY NINE WHEN HE HAD THUS MARRIED MARIAMNE HE
3723-171115-0031 SOSIUS ALSO JOINED HIM WITH A LARGE ARMY BOTH OF HORSEMEN AND FOOTMEN WHICH HE SENT BEFORE HIM THROUGH THE MIDLAND PARTS WHILE HE MARCHED HIMSELF ALONG PHOENICIA AND WHEN THE WHOLE ARMY WAS GOTTEN TOGETHER
3723-171115-0032 WHICH WERE ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF FOOTMEN AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE SYRIAN AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE NO SMALL PART OF THE ARMY THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR TO THE NORTH WALL HEROD'S DEPENDENCE WAS UPON THE DECREE OF THE SENATE
3723-171115-0033 BY WHICH HE WAS MADE KING AND SOSIUS RELIED UPON ANTONY WHO SENT THE ARMY THAT WAS UNDER HIM TO HEROD'S ASSISTANCE CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW HEROD AND SOSIUS TOOK JERUSALEM BY FORCE
3723-171115-0034 BEING THE WEAKER PART OF THEM GAVE IT OUT THAT AS THE TIMES WERE HE WAS THE HAPPIEST AND MOST RELIGIOUS MAN WHO SHOULD DIE FIRST BUT AS TO THE MORE BOLD AND HARDY MEN THEY GOT TOGETHER IN BODIES AND FELL A ROBBING OTHERS AFTER VARIOUS MANNERS
3723-171115-0035 AND THESE PARTICULARLY PLUNDERED THE PLACES THAT WERE ABOUT THE CITY AND THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT EITHER FOR THE HORSES OR THE MEN YET SOME OF THE WARLIKE MEN WHO WERE USED TO FIGHT REGULARLY WERE APPOINTED TO DEFEND THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE
3723-171115-0036 NOW AS FOR THE ROBBERIES WHICH WERE COMMITTED THE KING CONTRIVED THAT AMBUSHES SHOULD BE SO LAID THAT THEY MIGHT RESTRAIN THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS FOR THE WANT OF PROVISIONS HE PROVIDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THEM FROM GREAT DISTANCES
3723-171115-0037 HE WAS ALSO TOO HARD FOR THE JEWS BY THE ROMANS SKILL IN THE ART OF WAR ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BOLD TO THE UTMOST DEGREE NOW THEY DURST NOT COME TO A PLAIN BATTLE WITH THE ROMANS WHICH WAS CERTAIN DEATH
3723-171115-0038 BUT THROUGH THEIR MINES UNDER GROUND THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE MIDST OF THEM ON THE SUDDEN AND BEFORE THEY COULD BATTER DOWN ONE WALL THEY BUILT THEM ANOTHER IN ITS STEAD AND TO SUM UP ALL AT ONCE
3723-171115-0039 THEY BORE A SIEGE OF FIVE MONTHS TILL SOME OF HEROD'S CHOSEN MEN VENTURED TO GET UPON THE WALL AND FELL INTO THE CITY AS DID SOSIUS'S CENTURIONS AFTER THEM
3723-171115-0040 AND NOW THEY FIRST OF ALL SEIZED UPON WHAT WAS ABOUT THE TEMPLE AND UPON THE POURING IN OF THE ARMY THERE WAS SLAUGHTER OF VAST MULTITUDES EVERY WHERE BY REASON OF THE RAGE THE ROMANS WERE IN AT THE LENGTH OF THIS SIEGE
3723-171115-0041 AND BY REASON THAT THE JEWS WHO WERE ABOUT HEROD EARNESTLY ENDEAVORED THAT NONE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES MIGHT REMAIN SO THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES BY GREAT MULTITUDES AS THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN NARROW STREETS AND IN HOUSES OR WERE RUNNING AWAY TO THE TEMPLE
3723-171115-0042 NOBODY COULD BE PERSUADED TO WITHHOLD THEIR RIGHT HAND FROM SLAUGHTER BUT THEY SLEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES LIKE MADMEN THEN IT WAS THAT ANTIGONUS WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO HIS FORMER OR TO HIS PRESENT FORTUNE CAME DOWN FROM THE CITADEL
3723-171115-0043 OR LET HIM GO FREE BUT PUT HIM INTO BONDS AND KEPT HIM IN CUSTODY THREE BUT HEROD'S CONCERN AT PRESENT NOW HE HAD GOTTEN HIS ENEMIES UNDER HIS POWER
3723-171115-0044 WAS TO RESTRAIN THE ZEAL OF HIS FOREIGN AUXILIARIES FOR THE MULTITUDE OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE WERE VERY EAGER TO SEE THE TEMPLE AND WHAT WAS SACRED IN THE HOLY HOUSE ITSELF BUT THE KING ENDEAVORED TO RESTRAIN THEM PARTLY BY HIS EXHORTATIONS
3723-171115-0045 PARTLY BY HIS THREATENINGS NAY PARTLY BY FORCE AS THINKING THE VICTORY WORSE THAN A DEFEAT TO HIM IF ANY THING THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE SEEN WERE SEEN BY THEM
3723-171115-0046 HE ALSO FORBADE AT THE SAME TIME THE SPOILING OF THE CITY ASKING SOSIUS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER WHETHER THE ROMANS BY THUS EMPTYING THE CITY OF MONEY AND MEN HAD A MIND TO LEAVE HIM KING OF A DESERT
3723-171115-0047 AND TOLD HIM THAT HE JUDGED THE DOMINION OF THE HABITABLE EARTH TOO SMALL A COMPENSATION FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF SO MANY CITIZENS
3723-171115-0048 HEROD MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD GIVE EVERY ONE OF THE SOLDIERS A REWARD OUT OF HIS OWN MONEY SO HE PURCHASED THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS COUNTRY AND PERFORMED HIS PROMISES TO THEM AND MADE PRESENTS AFTER A MAGNIFICENT MANNER TO EACH SOLDIER
3723-171115-0049 AND PROPORTIONABLY TO THEIR COMMANDERS AND WITH A MOST ROYAL BOUNTY TO SOSIUS HIMSELF WHEREBY NOBODY WENT AWAY BUT IN A WEALTHY CONDITION HEREUPON SOSIUS DEDICATED A CROWN OF GOLD TO GOD AND THEN WENT AWAY FROM JERUSALEM
3723-171115-0050 LEADING ANTIGONUS AWAY IN BONDS TO ANTONY THEN DID THE AXE BRING HIM TO HIS END
3723-171115-0051 WHO STILL HAD A FOND DESIRE OF LIFE AND SOME FRIGID HOPES OF IT TO THE LAST BUT BY HIS COWARDLY BEHAVIOR WELL DESERVED TO DIE BY IT FOUR
3723-171115-0052 HEREUPON KING HEROD DISTINGUISHED THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS IN THE CITY
3723-171115-0053 NOW CLEOPATRA HAD PUT TO DEATH ALL HER KINDRED TILL NO ONE NEAR HER IN BLOOD REMAINED ALIVE AND AFTER THAT SHE FELL A SLAYING THOSE NO WAY RELATED TO HER SO SHE CALUMNIATED THE PRINCIPAL MEN AMONG THE SYRIANS TO ANTONY
3723-171115-0054 AND PERSUADED HIM TO HAVE THEM SLAIN THAT SO SHE MIGHT EASILY GAIN TO BE MISTRESS OF WHAT THEY HAD NAY SHE EXTENDED HER AVARICIOUS HUMOR TO THE JEWS AND ARABIANS
3723-171115-0055 AND SECRETLY LABORED TO HAVE HEROD AND MALICHUS THE KINGS OF BOTH THOSE NATIONS SLAIN BY HIS ORDER FIVE NOW IS TO THESE HER INJUNCTIONS TO ANTONY HE COMPLIED IN PART
3723-171115-0056 AND HAD CONDUCTED ANTONY IN HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS AS FAR AS EUPHRATES SHE CAME BY APAMIA AND DAMASCUS INTO JUDEA AND THERE DID HEROD PACIFY HER INDIGNATION AT HIM BY LARGE PRESENTS
3723-171115-0057 NOW IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT ANTONY WAS COME BACK FROM PARTHIA
