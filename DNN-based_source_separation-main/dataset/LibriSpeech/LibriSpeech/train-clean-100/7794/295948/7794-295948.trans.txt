7794-295948-0000 NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
7794-295948-0001 ALTHOUGH THE FAME OF HIS VIRTUE DID NOT REACH FAR YET HIS NEIGHBOURS RESPECTED AND REVERED HIM
7794-295948-0002 AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7794-295948-0003 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0004 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0005 WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7794-295948-0006 AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
7794-295948-0007 THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
7794-295948-0008 AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
7794-295948-0009 BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
7794-295948-0010 YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0013 THE SAME KIND FOLK HAVE PROMISED TO MEET AND BURY MY BODY THUS ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO WISH FOR MONEY STILL IF I HAD THREE RIYOS I WOULD OFFER THEM UP AT SOME HOLY SHRINE THAT MASSES AND PRAYERS MIGHT BE SAID FOR ME
7794-295948-0014 WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
7794-295948-0015 I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
7794-295948-0016 AND TRIED TO RETRACT WHAT HE HAD SAID POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AFTER ALL ARE THE WISH OF ORDINARY MEN I WHO AM A PRIEST OUGHT NOT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS OR TO WANT MONEY SO PRAY PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE SAID
7794-295948-0017 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0019 REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
7794-295948-0020 THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
7794-295948-0021 IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
7794-295948-0022 FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
7794-295948-0023 AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
7794-295948-0024 BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
7794-295948-0025 IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
