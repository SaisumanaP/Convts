8770-295462-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SMALL BOY HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE KEENEST SYMPATHY FOR THE HELPLESS AND OPPRESSED THE ONLY TIME HE BETRAYED ANGER AS A CHILD
8770-295462-0001 WHEN HE SAW THE OTHER BOYS HURTING A MUD TURTLE IN HIS FIRST SCHOOL COMPOSITION ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS HIS STEPSISTER REMEMBERS THIS SENTENCE AN ANT'S LIFE IS AS SWEET TO IT
8770-295462-0002 AS OURS IS TO US AS YOU HAVE READ ON AN EARLIER PAGE WHEN ABE GREW TO BE A BIG STRONG BOY HE SAVED A DRUNKEN MAN FROM FREEZING IN THE MUD BY CARRYING HIM TO A CABIN
8770-295462-0003 NOT ONLY FROM MUD AND COLD BUT ALSO FROM A DRUNKARD'S GRAVE FOR THAT TALL LAD'S LOVE AND MERCY REVEALED TO THE POOR CREATURE THE TERRIBLE SLAVERY OF WHICH HE WAS THE VICTIM
8770-295462-0004 HE DELIVERED AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE COMPARED WHITE SLAVERY WITH BLACK IN WHICH HE SAID AND WHEN THE VICTORY SHALL BE COMPLETE
8770-295462-0005 THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF WASHINGTON WE ARE MET TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY WASHINGTON IS THE MIGHTIEST NAME OF EARTH LONG SINCE THE MIGHTIEST IN THE CAUSE OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8770-295462-0006 STILL MIGHTIEST IN MORAL REFORMATION ON THAT NAME NO EULOGY IS EXPECTED IT CANNOT BE TO ADD TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN OR GLORY TO THE NAME OF WASHINGTON IS ALIKE IMPOSSIBLE
8770-295462-0007 WHICH DID SO MUCH TO BRING ABOUT IN TIME A DOUBLE EMANCIPATION FROM WHITE SLAVERY AND BLACK ONCE AS PRESIDENT HE SAID TO A BOY WHO HAD JUST SIGNED THE TEMPERANCE PLEDGE NOW SONNY
8770-295462-0008 KEEP THAT PLEDGE AND IT WILL BE THE BEST ACT OF YOUR LIFE PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRUE AND CONSISTENT IN HIS TEMPERANCE PRINCIPLES IN MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR HE WENT BY STEAMBOAT WITH HIS WIFE
8770-295462-0009 AND LITTLE TAD TO VISIT GENERAL GRANT AT HIS HEADQUARTERS AT CITY POINT VIRGINIA WHEN ASKED HOW HE WAS DURING THE RECEPTION WHICH FOLLOWED HIS ARRIVAL THERE THE PRESIDENT SAID AS RELATED BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER
8770-295462-0010 THAT'S THE BEST REMEDY I KNOW OF FOR SEA SICKNESS NO NO MY YOUNG FRIEND REPLIED THE PRESIDENT I'VE SEEN MANY A MAN IN MY TIME SEASICK ASHORE FROM DRINKING THAT VERY ARTICLE
8770-295462-0011 AND THE BITTEREST NAME HIS ENEMIES CALLED HIM WORSE IN THEIR MINDS THAN FOOL CLOWN IMBECILE OR GORILLA WAS A BLACK REPUBLICAN
8770-295462-0012 THE MORE THEY NEEDED HIS SYMPATHETIC HELP THE MORE CERTAIN THEY WERE TO RECEIVE IT MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE UNDER DOG SAID MISTER LINCOLN ONE DAY THOUGH IT IS OFTEN THAT DOG THAT STARTS THE FUSS
8770-295462-0013 DID NOT MAKE HIM FORFEIT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SYMPATHY THAT WAS ONLY A GOOD LESSON TO HIM TO LOOK OUT AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME THE QUESTION OF EMANCIPATION
8770-295462-0014 IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BACK UP SUCH A DECLARATION THE OTHER PARTY DID NOT WISH THE MATTER TAMPERED WITH AS CHEAP LABOR WAS NECESSARY FOR RAISING COTTON SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE LIVING OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DEPENDED
8770-295462-0015 THE EXTREME ABOLITIONISTS WHO WISHED SLAVERY ABOLISHED WHETHER OR NO SENT MEN TO TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT IF HE DID NOT FREE THE SLAVES HE WAS A COWARD AND A TURNCOAT
8770-295462-0016 AND THEY WOULD WITHHOLD THEIR SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY DELEGATIONS OF ABOLITIONISTS FROM ALL OVER THE NORTH ARRIVED ALMOST DAILY FROM DIFFERENT CITIES TO URGE COAX AND THREATEN THE PRESIDENT
8770-295462-0017 WASHINGTON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL WOULD HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED AND FORCED TO SURRENDER BESIDES AT THIS TIME THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH WERE LOSING NEARLY ALL THE BATTLES
8770-295462-0018 IT WOULD BE LIKE THE POPE'S BULL OR DECREE AGAINST THE COMET A DELEGATION OF CHICAGO MINISTERS CAME TO BEG MISTER LINCOLN TO FREE THE SLAVES HE PATIENTLY EXPLAINED TO THEM
8770-295462-0019 COMPELS ME TO SAY TO YOU IN REPLY THAT IT IS A MESSAGE FROM OUR DIVINE MASTER THROUGH ME COMMANDING YOU SIR TO OPEN THE DOORS OF BONDAGE
8770-295462-0020 NOW ISN'T THAT STRANGE THE PRESIDENT REPLIED INSTANTLY HERE I AM STUDYING THIS QUESTION DAY AND NIGHT AND GOD HAS PLACED IT UPON ME TOO
8770-295462-0021 DON'T YOU THINK IT'S RATHER ODD THAT HE SHOULD SEND SUCH A MESSAGE BY WAY OF THAT AWFUL WICKED CITY OF CHICAGO THE MINISTERS WERE SHOCKED AT SUCH AN ANSWER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295462-0022 THEY COULD NOT KNOW FOR MISTER LINCOLN DARED NOT TELL THEM THAT HE HAD THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN HIS POCKET WAITING FOR A FEDERAL VICTORY BEFORE HE COULD ISSUE IT THE PROCLAMATION
8770-295462-0023 THEN CAME THE NEWS OF ANTIETAM A TERRIBLE BATTLE BUT GAINED BY THE NORTHERN ARMS AT LAST THE TIME HAD COME TO ANNOUNCE THE FREEING OF THE SLAVES THAT THEY MIGHT HELP IN WINNING THEIR LIBERTIES
8770-295462-0024 THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT HELD A MEETING OF HIS CABINET FOR SOME TIME HE THOUGHT OF THE OCCASION WHEN AS A YOUNG MAN HE WENT ON A FLATBOAT TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND SAW
8770-295462-0025 I'LL HIT IT HARD NOW THE CHANCE TO HIT THAT THING THE INHUMAN MONSTER OF HUMAN SLAVERY HAD COME AND HE WAS GOING TO HIT IT HARD HE CALLED THE CABINET TOGETHER
8770-295462-0026 EDWIN M STANTON THE SECRETARY OF WAR HAS DESCRIBED THE SCENE ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO I HAD A SUDDEN AND PEREMPTORY CALL TO A CABINET MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295462-0027 I WENT IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND THE HISTORIC WAR CABINET OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSEMBLED EVERY MEMBER BEING PRESENT THE PRESIDENT HARDLY NOTICED ME AS I CAME IN
8770-295462-0028 LET ME READ YOU A CHAPTER THAT IS VERY FUNNY NOT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET SMILED AS FOR MYSELF I WAS ANGRY AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE BUFFOONERY
8770-295462-0029 HE HOWEVER CONCLUDED TO READ US A CHAPTER FROM ARTEMUS WARD WHICH HE DID WITH GREAT DELIBERATION HAVING FINISHED HE LAUGHED HEARTILY WITHOUT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET JOINING IN THE LAUGHTER
8770-295462-0030 WELL HE SAID LET'S HAVE ANOTHER CHAPTER I WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER I SHOULD RISE AND LEAVE THE MEETING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE THREW THE BOOK DOWN HEAVED A LONG SIGH AND SAID
8770-295462-0031 GENTLEMEN WHY DON'T YOU LAUGH WITH THE FEARFUL STRAIN THAT IS UPON ME NIGHT AND DAY IF I DID NOT LAUGH I SHOULD DIE AND YOU NEED THIS MEDICINE AS MUCH AS I DO
8770-295462-0032 HE THEN PUT HIS HAND IN HIS TALL HAT THAT SAT UPON THE TABLE AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE PAPER TURNING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET HE SAID GENTLEMEN I HAVE CALLED YOU HERE UPON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
8770-295462-0033 IT IS DUE TO MY CABINET THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND KNOW OF IT AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE AS TO THE FORM OF THIS PAPER OR ITS COMPOSITION I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR THEM
8770-295462-0034 WHICH WAS TO TAKE EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY FOLLOWING SECRETARY STANTON CONTINUED I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE CALM BUT I THINK I LOST MY CALMNESS FOR A MOMENT AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM I AROSE
