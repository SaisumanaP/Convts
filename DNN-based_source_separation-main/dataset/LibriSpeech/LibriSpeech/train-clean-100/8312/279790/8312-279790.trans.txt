8312-279790-0000 WHERE HE SPENT HIS TIME IN KNOCKING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL UNTIL THE COURTIERS WERE AFRAID HE WOULD KILL HIMSELF THEY ACCORDINGLY PLACED STUFFED MATTRESSES OVER EVERY WALL AND ALLOWED ALL HIS SUBJECTS WHO DESIRED
8312-279790-0001 COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN A LONG CRAPE VEIL WHO WEPT AND SOBBED SO MUCH THAT THE KING NOTICED HER SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE DID NOT COME LIKE THE REST TO CONSOLE HIM BUT RATHER TO ENCOURAGE HIS GRIEF
8312-279790-0002 SHE HERSELF HAD LOST THE BEST OF HUSBANDS AND HERE SHE BEGAN TO WEEP SO PROFUSELY THAT IT WAS A WONDER HER EYES WERE NOT MELTED OUT OF HER HEAD THE KING BEGAN TO WEEP IN COMPANY AND TO TALK TO HER OF HIS DEAR WIFE
8312-279790-0003 SHE DID THE SAME OF HER DEAR HUSBAND IN FACT THEY TALKED SO MUCH THAT THEY TALKED THEIR SORROW QUITE AWAY THEN LIFTING UP HER VEIL SHE SHOWED LOVELY BLUE EYES AND DARK EYELASHES
8312-279790-0004 THE KING NOTICED HER MORE AND MORE HE SPOKE LESS AND LESS OF THE DEPARTED QUEEN BY AND BY HE CEASED TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL THE END WAS THAT HE COURTED THE INCONSOLABLE LADY IN THE BLACK VEIL AND MARRIED HER
8312-279790-0005 BY HIS FIRST MARRIAGE HE HAD ONE DAUGHTER CALLED FLORINA OR THE LITTLE FLORA BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FRESH AND LOVELY AT THE TIME OF HIS SECOND MARRIAGE SHE WAS QUITE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THE NEW QUEEN ALSO HAD A DAUGHTER
8312-279790-0006 WHO WAS BEING BROUGHT UP BY HER GODMOTHER THE FAIRY SOUSSIO HER NAME WAS TROUTINA BECAUSE HER COMPLEXION WAS ALL SPOTTED LIKE A TROUT'S BACK INDEED SHE WAS ALTOGETHER UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE AND WHEN CONTRASTED WITH FLORINA
8312-279790-0007 THE KING DISPUTED NOTHING INDEED HE NEVER DID THE QUEEN RULED HIM IN ALL THINGS SOME TIME AFTER NEWS CAME THAT KING CHARMING WOULD SHORTLY ARRIVE
8312-279790-0008 WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS NEWS SHE SENT FOR MILLINERS DRESSMAKERS JEWELLERS AND DECKED TROUTINA FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT TO FLORINA SHE ALLOWED NOT A SINGLE NEW FROCK THE POOR PRINCESS HAD TO PUT ON HER OLD ONE
8312-279790-0009 WHO PRESENTED TO HIM TROUTINA ALL BLAZING WITH JEWELS YET SO UGLY THAT KING CHARMING INVOLUNTARILY TURNED AWAY HIS EYES BUT MADAM IS THERE NOT ANOTHER PRINCESS CALLED FLORINA
8312-279790-0010 HE ROSE AND MADE HER A PROFOUND REVERENCE PAYING HER BESIDES SO MANY ELEGANT COMPLIMENTS THAT THE QUEEN BECAME VERY MUCH DISPLEASED KING CHARMING TOOK NO HEED
8312-279790-0011 BUT CONVERSED WITH FLORINA FOR THREE HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING INDEED HIS ADMIRATION OF HER WAS SO PLAIN THAT THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA BEGGED OF THE KING THAT SHE MIGHT BE SHUT UP IN A TOWER DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS VISIT
8312-279790-0012 FOUR MEN IN MASKS ENTERED AND CARRIED HER OFF LEAVING HER IN A DARK CELL AND IN THE UTMOST DESOLATION MEANTIME KING CHARMING EAGERLY AWAITED HER RE APPEARANCE BUT HE SAW HER NO MORE
8312-279790-0013 AND BY THE QUEEN'S ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM SPOKE ALL THE EVIL THEY COULD OF POOR FLORINA BUT HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE ONE WORD NO SAID HE NATURE COULD NOT HAVE UNITED A BASE NATURE TO SUCH A SWEET INNOCENT FACE
8312-279790-0014 FLORINA SHUT UP IN HER TOWER LAMENTED BITTERLY AH WOULD I HAD BEEN SENT HERE BEFORE I SAW THIS AMIABLE PRINCE WHO WAS SO KIND TO ME IT IS TO PREVENT MY MEETING HIM AGAIN THAT THE QUEEN TREATS ME SO CRUELLY

8312-279790-0016 BUT PIERCED BY ONE ONLY THE MOTTO BEING SHE ALONE THE HEART WAS MADE OF A SINGLE RUBY AS BIG AS AN OSTRICH'S EGG
8312-279790-0017 A FINGER'S LENGTH AND THE CHAIN WAS OF PEARLS EACH WEIGHING A POUND WHEN THE YOUNG KING RECEIVED THIS VERY HANDSOME PRESENT HE WAS MUCH PERPLEXED
8312-279790-0018 AS I CANNOT FULFIL IT TO TROUTINA I WOULD RATHER DECLINE THE FAVOUR SHE OFFERS ME THAN BECOME UNWORTHY OF IT CIVIL AS THIS ANSWER WAS IT IRRITATED THE QUEEN AND HER DAUGHTER EXCEEDINGLY
8312-279790-0019 AND WHEN SINCE IN ALL HIS AUDIENCES WITH THEIR MAJESTIES HE NEVER SAW FLORINA HE AT LAST INQUIRED WHERE THE YOUNGER PRINCESS WAS THE QUEEN ANSWERED FIERCELY THAT SHE WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON AND WOULD REMAIN THERE TILL TROUTINA WAS MARRIED
8312-279790-0020 WHEN HE WAS ALONE HE SENT FOR ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS WHOM HE TRUSTED VERY MUCH AND BEGGED HIM TO GAIN INFORMATION FROM SOME COURT LADY ABOUT THE PRINCESS FLORINA THIS SCHEME SUCCEEDED SO WELL

8312-279790-0034 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SINGING VOICE AND THEN UTTERING A DOLEFUL CRY FLED AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FATAL PALACE OF SOUSSIO BUT THOUGH HE LOOKED ONLY A BLUE BIRD
8312-279790-0035 THE KING WAS HIS OWN NATURAL SELF STILL AND REMEMBERED ALL HIS MISFORTUNES AND DID NOT CEASE TO LAMENT FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL FLORINA FLYING FROM TREE TO TREE HE SANG MELANCHOLY SONGS ABOUT HER AND HIMSELF
