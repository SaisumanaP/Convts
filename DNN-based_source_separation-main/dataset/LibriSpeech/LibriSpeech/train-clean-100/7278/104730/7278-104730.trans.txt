7278-104730-0005 OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF CONGRESS THE BUSINESS OF FIRING THE PEOPLE AND STIRRING POPULAR OPINION AND SYMPATHY HE WAS SET TO DO THAT PORTION OF THE WORK OF ABOLITION WHICH WAS TO BE DONE IN CONGRESS
7278-104730-0006 TO ENCOUNTER THE MIGHTY EFFORTS WHICH WERE MADE TO STIFLE THE GREAT HUMANITARIAN CRY IN THE HALLS OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE THIS WAS QUITE AS MUCH AS ONE MAN WAS EQUAL TO
7278-104730-0007 OVERAWE HIM NOR LONELINESS DISPIRIT HIM HE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST FORMIDABLE FIGHTER IN DEBATE OF WHOM PARLIAMENTARY RECORDS PRESERVE THE MEMORY

7278-104730-0024 NO ONE EVER GAINED MUCH IN A WAR OF WORDS WITH THIS EVER READY AND MERCILESS TONGUE
7278-104730-0025 INCIPIENT STAGE OF SUCH A CONFLICT THAT TESTS THE METTLE OF THE LITTLE BAND OF INNOVATORS WHEN IT GROWS INTO A GREAT PARTY QUESTION MUCH LESS COURAGE IS DEMANDED THE MERE PRESENTATION OF AN
7278-104730-0026 AS THEN MADE UP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WORE HARDLY EVEN UPON THE IRON TEMPER AND INFLEXIBLE DISPOSITION OF MISTER ADAMS THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT ERROR OF CONDUCT IN ME AT THIS TIME HE WRITES IN APRIL
