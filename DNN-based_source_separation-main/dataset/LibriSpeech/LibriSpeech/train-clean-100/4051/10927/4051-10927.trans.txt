4051-10927-0000 IT'S LATE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE SAID WHEN SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THE DOORWAY ANNA IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU WITH ME SHE SAID WONDERINGLY SHE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE DRESSING ROOM AND LOOKED AT HIM
4051-10927-0001 WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
4051-10927-0002 HOW SIMPLE AND NATURAL WERE HER WORDS AND HOW LIKELY THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY SLEEPY
4051-10927-0003 THAT ANYONE WHO DID NOT KNOW HER AS HER HUSBAND KNEW HER COULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING UNNATURAL EITHER IN THE SOUND OR THE SENSE OF HER WORDS BUT TO HIM KNOWING HER KNOWING THAT WHENEVER HE WENT TO BED FIVE MINUTES LATER THAN USUAL
4051-10927-0004 SHE NOTICED IT AND ASKED HIM THE REASON TO HIM KNOWING THAT EVERY JOY EVERY PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT SHE FELT SHE COMMUNICATED TO HIM AT ONCE TO HIM NOW TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO NOTICE HIS STATE OF MIND
4051-10927-0005 THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HERSELF MEANT A GREAT DEAL HE SAW THAT THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER SOUL THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO LAIN OPEN BEFORE HIM WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM MORE THAN THAT HE SAW FROM HER TONE
4051-10927-0006 THAT SHE WAS NOT EVEN PERTURBED AT THAT BUT AS IT WERE SAID STRAIGHT OUT TO HIM YES IT'S SHUT UP AND SO IT MUST BE AND WILL BE IN FUTURE NOW HE EXPERIENCED A FEELING SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT HAVE RETURNING HOME AND FINDING HIS OWN HOUSE LOCKED UP
4051-10927-0007 BUT PERHAPS THE KEY MAY YET BE FOUND THOUGHT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I WANT TO WARN YOU HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THROUGH THOUGHTLESSNESS AND LACK OF CAUTION
4051-10927-0008 YOUR TOO ANIMATED CONVERSATION THIS EVENING WITH COUNT VRONSKY HE ENUNCIATED THE NAME FIRMLY AND WITH DELIBERATE EMPHASIS ATTRACTED ATTENTION HE TALKED AND LOOKED AT HER LAUGHING EYES WHICH FRIGHTENED HIM NOW WITH THEIR IMPENETRABLE LOOK
4051-10927-0009 I WASN'T DULL DOES THAT OFFEND YOU ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHIVERED AND BENT HIS HANDS TO MAKE THE JOINTS CRACK
4051-10927-0010 ANNA IS THIS YOU SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH QUIETLY MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF AND RESTRAINING THE MOTION OF HIS FINGERS
4051-10927-0011 WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH PAUSED AND RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS EYES HE SAW THAT INSTEAD OF DOING AS HE HAD INTENDED THAT IS TO SAY WARNING HIS WIFE AGAINST A MISTAKE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD
4051-10927-0012 HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
4051-10927-0013 AND I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO IT I CONSIDER JEALOUSY AS YOU KNOW A HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING FEELING AND I SHALL NEVER ALLOW MYSELF TO BE INFLUENCED BY IT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES OF DECORUM WHICH CANNOT BE DISREGARDED WITH IMPUNITY THIS EVENING IT WAS NOT I OBSERVED IT
4051-10927-0014 BUT JUDGING BY THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE COMPANY EVERYONE OBSERVED THAT YOUR CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WHAT COULD BE DESIRED I POSITIVELY DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE DOESN'T CARE SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0015 BUT OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED IT AND THAT'S WHAT UPSETS HIM YOU'RE NOT WELL ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE ADDED AND SHE GOT UP AND WOULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT HE MOVED FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WOULD STOP HER HIS FACE WAS UGLY AND FORBIDDING
4051-10927-0016 AS ANNA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SHE STOPPED AND BENDING HER HEAD BACK AND ON ONE SIDE BEGAN WITH HER RAPID HAND TAKING OUT HER HAIRPINS WELL I'M LISTENING TO WHAT'S TO COME SHE SAID CALMLY AND IRONICALLY AND INDEED I LISTEN WITH INTEREST
4051-10927-0017 BEGAN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH FERRETING IN ONE'S SOUL ONE OFTEN FERRETS OUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE LAIN THERE UNNOTICED YOUR FEELINGS ARE AN AFFAIR OF YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
4051-10927-0018 TO MYSELF AND TO GOD TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOUR DUTIES OUR LIFE HAS BEEN JOINED NOT BY MAN BUT BY GOD THAT UNION CAN ONLY BE SEVERED BY A CRIME AND A CRIME OF THAT NATURE BRINGS ITS OWN CHASTISEMENT
4051-10927-0019 I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD AND OH DEAR HOW SLEEPY I AM UNLUCKILY SHE SAID RAPIDLY PASSING HER HAND THROUGH HER HAIR FEELING FOR THE REMAINING HAIRPINS ANNA FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT HE SAID GENTLY PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN
4051-10927-0020 BUT BELIEVE ME WHAT I SAY I SAY AS MUCH FOR MYSELF AS FOR YOU I AM YOUR HUSBAND AND I LOVE YOU FOR AN INSTANT HER FACE FELL AND THE MOCKING GLEAM IN HER EYES DIED AWAY BUT THE WORD LOVE THREW HER INTO REVOLT AGAIN SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0021 LOVE CAN HE LOVE IF HE HADN'T HEARD THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS LOVE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE USED THE WORD HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH REALLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND SHE SAID DEFINE WHAT IT IS YOU FIND
4051-10927-0022 THAT MY WORDS SEEM TO YOU UTTERLY UNNECESSARY AND OUT OF PLACE
4051-10927-0023 IN THAT CASE I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YOURSELF OF EVEN THE SMALLEST FOUNDATION FOR THEM
4051-10927-0024 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE BEDROOM HE WAS ALREADY IN BED HIS LIPS WERE STERNLY COMPRESSED AND HIS EYES LOOKED AWAY FROM HER ANNA GOT INTO HER BED AND LAY EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN SHE BOTH FEARED HIS SPEAKING AND WISHED FOR IT
4051-10927-0025 BUT HE WAS SILENT SHE WAITED FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT MOVING AND HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM SHE THOUGHT OF THAT OTHER SHE PICTURED HIM AND FELT HOW HER HEART WAS FLOODED WITH EMOTION AND GUILTY DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM SUDDENLY
4051-10927-0026 SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
4051-10927-0027 WITH A NEW TRANQUIL RHYTHM IT'S LATE IT'S LATE SHE WHISPERED WITH A SMILE
