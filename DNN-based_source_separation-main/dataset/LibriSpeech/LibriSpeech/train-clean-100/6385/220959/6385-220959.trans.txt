6385-220959-0000 PART TWO SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS
6385-220959-0001 OUTWARD FORMS AND SYMBOLS MUST BE USED TO CONVEY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTIONS
6385-220959-0002 AND OF OTHERS OF WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO SPEAK SO THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEMS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD IS THIS THAT HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IS OF TWO KINDS ONE IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES
6385-220959-0003 THAT IS TO SAY THINGS WHICH THE EYE OR EAR OR SMELL OR TASTE OR TOUCH CAN PERCEIVE WHICH ARE CALLED OBJECTIVE OR SENSIBLE SO THE SUN BECAUSE IT CAN BE SEEN IS SAID TO BE OBJECTIVE
6385-220959-0004 IT IS A REALITY OF THE INTELLECT IT HAS NO OUTWARD FORM AND NO PLACE AND IS NOT PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES FOR EXAMPLE THE POWER OF INTELLECT IS NOT SENSIBLE NONE OF THE INNER QUALITIES OF MAN IS A SENSIBLE THING
6385-220959-0005 ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES SO LOVE IS A MENTAL REALITY AND NOT SENSIBLE FOR THIS REALITY THE EAR DOES NOT HEAR THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THE SMELL DOES NOT PERCEIVE
6385-220959-0006 THE TASTE DOES NOT DISCERN THE TOUCH DOES NOT FEEL EVEN ETHEREAL MATTER THE FORCES OF WHICH ARE SAID IN PHYSICS TO BE HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
6385-220959-0007 IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND IS NOT SENSIBLE IN THE SAME WAY NATURE ALSO IN ITS ESSENCE IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND IS NOT SENSIBLE THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS AN INTELLECTUAL NOT SENSIBLE REALITY
6385-220959-0008 IN EXPLAINING THESE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES ONE IS OBLIGED TO EXPRESS THEM BY SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN EXTERIOR EXISTENCE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT MATERIAL THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT
6385-220959-0009 ITS CONDITION ITS STATION ONE IS OBLIGED TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS UNDER THE FORMS OF SENSIBLE THINGS BECAUSE IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD ALL THAT EXISTS IS SENSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE GRIEF AND HAPPINESS ARE INTELLECTUAL THINGS
6385-220959-0010 THIS IS AN INTELLECTUAL OR SPIRITUAL STATE TO EXPLAIN WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU SAY SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL MADE GREAT PROGRESS
6385-220959-0011 THOUGH HE IS REMAINING IN THE SAME PLACE OR AGAIN SUCH A ONE'S POSITION WAS EXALTED ALTHOUGH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HE WALKS UPON THE EARTH THIS EXALTATION AND THIS PROGRESS ARE SPIRITUAL STATES AND INTELLECTUAL REALITIES
6385-220959-0012 BUT TO EXPLAIN THEM YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN THE EXTERIOR WORLD THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT SENSIBLE SO THE SYMBOL OF KNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT AND OF IGNORANCE DARKNESS BUT REFLECT
6385-220959-0013 IS KNOWLEDGE SENSIBLE LIGHT OR IGNORANCE SENSIBLE DARKNESS NO THEY ARE MERELY SYMBOLS THESE ARE ONLY INTELLECTUAL STATES
6385-220959-0014 BUT WHEN YOU DESIRE TO EXPRESS THEM OUTWARDLY YOU CALL KNOWLEDGE LIGHT AND IGNORANCE DARKNESS YOU SAY MY HEART WAS GLOOMY AND IT BECAME ENLIGHTENED
6385-220959-0015 NOW THAT LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES NOT SENSIBLE ONES BUT WHEN WE SEEK FOR EXPLANATIONS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE ARE OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM A SENSIBLE FORM
6385-220959-0016 THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE DOVE WHICH DESCENDED UPON CHRIST WAS NOT A MATERIAL DOVE BUT IT WAS A SPIRITUAL STATE WHICH THAT IT MIGHT BE COMPREHENSIBLE WAS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE FIGURE
6385-220959-0017 THUS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IT IS SAID THAT GOD APPEARED AS A PILLAR OF FIRE THIS DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE MATERIAL FORM IT IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE IMAGE
6385-220959-0018 A SIMILE A METAPHOR AND IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED LITERALLY IT IS NOT A STATE THAT CAN BE COMPREHENDED BY MAN SLEEPING AND WAKING IS PASSING FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER SLEEPING IS THE CONDITION OF REPOSE
6385-220959-0019 AND WAKEFULNESS IS THE CONDITION OF MOVEMENT SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF SILENCE
6385-220959-0020 SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF MYSTERY WAKEFULNESS IS THE STATE OF MANIFESTATION FOR EXAMPLE IT IS A PERSIAN AND ARABIC EXPRESSION TO SAY THAT THE EARTH WAS ASLEEP AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT AWOKE
6385-220959-0021 OR THE EARTH WAS DEAD AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT REVIVED THESE EXPRESSIONS ARE METAPHORS ALLEGORIES MYSTIC EXPLANATIONS IN THE WORLD OF SIGNIFICATION BRIEFLY THE HOLY MANIFESTATIONS HAVE EVER BEEN
6385-220959-0022 AND EVER WILL BE LUMINOUS REALITIES NO CHANGE OR VARIATION TAKES PLACE IN THEIR ESSENCE BEFORE DECLARING THEIR MANIFESTATION THEY ARE SILENT AND QUIET LIKE A SLEEPER AND AFTER THEIR MANIFESTATION THEY SPEAK AND ARE ILLUMINATED
6385-220959-0023 IN REGARD TO THIS QUESTION THEOLOGIANS AND MATERIALISTS DISAGREE THE THEOLOGIANS BELIEVE THAT CHRIST WAS BORN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BUT THE MATERIALISTS THINK THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE AND INADMISSIBLE
6385-220959-0024 AND THAT WITHOUT DOUBT HE HAD A HUMAN FATHER IN THE QUR'AN IT IS SAID AND WE SENT OUR SPIRIT UNTO HER
6385-220959-0025 AND HE ADDRESSED MARY THE MATERIALISTS BELIEVE THAT THERE MUST BE MARRIAGE AND SAY THAT A LIVING BODY CANNOT BE CREATED FROM A LIFELESS BODY AND WITHOUT MALE AND FEMALE THERE CANNOT BE FECUNDATION AND THEY THINK THAT NOT ONLY WITH MAN
6385-220959-0026 AND OF EVERYTHING HAVE WE CREATED TWO KINDS THAT IS TO SAY WE HAVE CREATED ALL THE BEINGS THROUGH PAIRING BRIEFLY THEY SAY A MAN WITHOUT A HUMAN FATHER CANNOT BE IMAGINED
6385-220959-0027 IN ANSWER THE THEOLOGIANS SAY THIS THING IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND UNACHIEVABLE BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN AND THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THING WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE AND ONE WHICH IS UNKNOWN FOR EXAMPLE
6385-220959-0028 IN FORMER TIMES THE TELEGRAPH WHICH CAUSES THE EAST AND THE WEST TO COMMUNICATE WAS UNKNOWN BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE PHOTOGRAPHY AND PHONOGRAPHY WERE UNKNOWN BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE
6385-220959-0029 THE MATERIALISTS INSIST UPON THIS BELIEF AND THE THEOLOGIANS REPLY IS THIS GLOBE ETERNAL OR PHENOMENAL THE MATERIALISTS ANSWER THAT ACCORDING TO SCIENCE AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT IT IS PHENOMENAL
6385-220959-0030 IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A FLAMING GLOBE AND GRADUALLY IT BECAME TEMPERATE A CRUST WAS FORMED AROUND IT AND UPON THIS CRUST PLANTS CAME INTO EXISTENCE THEN ANIMALS AND FINALLY MAN THE THEOLOGIANS SAY
6385-220959-0031 IS NOT THE CREATION OF MAN WITHOUT FATHER AND MOTHER EVEN THOUGH GRADUALLY MORE DIFFICULT THAN IF HE HAD SIMPLY COME INTO EXISTENCE WITHOUT A FATHER AS YOU ADMIT THAT THE FIRST MAN CAME INTO EXISTENCE WITHOUT FATHER OR MOTHER
6385-220959-0032 WHETHER IT BE GRADUALLY OR AT ONCE THERE CAN REMAIN NO DOUBT THAT A MAN WITHOUT A HUMAN FATHER IS ALSO POSSIBLE AND ADMISSIBLE YOU CANNOT CONSIDER THIS IMPOSSIBLE OTHERWISE YOU ARE ILLOGICAL FOR EXAMPLE
6385-220959-0033 IF YOU SAY THAT THIS LAMP HAS ONCE BEEN LIGHTED WITHOUT WICK AND OIL AND THEN SAY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIGHT IT WITHOUT THE WICK THIS IS ILLOGICAL CHRIST HAD A MOTHER THE FIRST MAN AS THE MATERIALISTS BELIEVE
6385-220959-0034 THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS DUE TO HIS PERFECTIONS A GREAT MAN IS A GREAT MAN WHETHER BORN OF A HUMAN FATHER OR NOT IF BEING WITHOUT A FATHER IS A VIRTUE
6385-220959-0035 WHICH CAN BE COMPARED TO FATHER AND MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION BUT THE DARKNESS HAS NEITHER SUBSTANCE NOR FORM NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE IMPERFECTION THE SUBSTANCE OF ADAM'S PHYSICAL LIFE WAS EARTH
6385-220959-0036 BUT THE SUBSTANCE OF ABRAHAM WAS PURE SPERM IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PURE AND CHASTE SPERM IS SUPERIOR TO EARTH FURTHERMORE IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN VERSES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN IT IS SAID
6385-220959-0037 EVEN TO THEM THAT BELIEVED ON HIS NAME WHICH WERE BORN NOT OF BLOOD NOR OF THE WILL OF THE FLESH NOR OF THE WILL OF MAN
6385-220959-0038 ALSO IS NOT CREATED BY PHYSICAL POWER BUT BY THE SPIRITUAL REALITY THE HONOR AND GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS NOT DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A HUMAN FATHER BUT TO HIS PERFECTIONS BOUNTIES AND DIVINE GLORY
6385-220959-0039 IF THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS HIS BEING FATHERLESS THEN ADAM IS GREATER THAN CHRIST FOR HE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER IT IS SAID IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE LORD GOD FORMED MAN OF THE DUST OF THE GROUND
6385-220959-0040 AND BREATHED INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE
6385-220959-0041 MOREOVER THE EXPRESSION WHICH JOHN USES IN REGARD TO THE DISCIPLES PROVES THAT THEY ALSO ARE FROM THE HEAVENLY FATHER HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HOLY REALITY MEANING THE REAL EXISTENCE OF EVERY GREAT MAN COMES FROM GOD
6385-220959-0042 AND OWES ITS BEING TO THE BREATH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
6385-220959-0043 FOR HE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER IS IT BETTER FOR A MAN TO BE CREATED FROM A LIVING SUBSTANCE OR FROM EARTH CERTAINLY IT IS BETTER IF HE BE CREATED FROM A LIVING SUBSTANCE BUT CHRIST WAS BORN AND CAME INTO EXISTENCE FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT
