6529-62556-0000 AT HERBERT'S CRY PENCROFT LETTING HIS GUN FALL RUSHED TOWARDS HIM THEY HAVE KILLED HIM HE CRIED MY BOY THEY HAVE KILLED HIM CYRUS HARDING AND GIDEON SPILETT RAN TO HERBERT THE REPORTER LISTENED TO ASCERTAIN IF THE POOR LAD'S HEART WAS STILL BEATING
6529-62556-0001 HE LIVES SAID HE BUT HE MUST BE CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED THE ENGINEER INTO THE CORRAL THEN SAID PENCROFT IN A MOMENT SAID HARDING AND HE RAN ROUND THE LEFT CORNER OF THE PALISADE
6529-62556-0002 THERE HE FOUND A CONVICT WHO AIMING AT HIM SENT A BALL THROUGH HIS HAT IN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HAD EVEN TIME TO FIRE HIS SECOND BARREL HE FELL STRUCK TO THE HEART BY HARDING'S DAGGER MORE SURE EVEN THAN HIS GUN DURING THIS TIME
6529-62556-0003 GIDEON SPILETT AND THE SAILOR HOISTED THEMSELVES OVER THE PALISADE LEAPED INTO THE ENCLOSURE THREW DOWN THE PROPS WHICH SUPPORTED THE INNER DOOR RAN INTO THE EMPTY HOUSE AND SOON POOR HERBERT WAS LYING ON AYRTON'S BED IN A FEW MOMENTS HARDING WAS BY HIS SIDE
6529-62556-0004 ON SEEING HERBERT SENSELESS THE SAILOR'S GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE HE SOBBED HE CRIED HE TRIED TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE REPORTER COULD CALM HIM
6529-62556-0005 WITHOUT ACQUIRING SOME SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE HE KNEW A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ATTEND TO WOUNDS PRODUCED EITHER BY A SWORD BAYONET OR SHOT ASSISTED BY CYRUS HARDING HE PROCEEDED TO RENDER THE AID HERBERT REQUIRED
6529-62556-0006 THE REPORTER WAS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE STUPOR IN WHICH HERBERT LAY A STUPOR OWING EITHER TO THE HEMORRHAGE OR TO THE SHOCK THE BALL HAVING STRUCK A BONE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO PRODUCE A VIOLENT CONCUSSION HERBERT WAS DEADLY PALE AND HIS PULSE SO FEEBLE
6529-62556-0007 THAT SPILETT ONLY FELT IT BEAT AT LONG INTERVALS AS IF IT WAS ON THE POINT OF STOPPING THESE SYMPTOMS WERE VERY SERIOUS HERBERT'S CHEST WAS LAID BARE AND THE BLOOD HAVING BEEN STANCHED WITH HANDKERCHIEFS IT WAS BATHED WITH COLD WATER
6529-62556-0008 HE UTTERED A MOAN SO FEEBLE THAT THEY ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS HIS LAST SIGH HERBERTS BACK WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM ANOTHER CONTUSED WOUND BY WHICH THE BALL HAD IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED GOD BE PRAISED SAID THE REPORTER THE BALL IS NOT IN THE BODY AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT IT
6529-62556-0009 BUT THE HEART ASKED HARDING THE HEART HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED IF IT HAD BEEN HERBERT WOULD BE DEAD DEAD EXCLAIMED PENCROFT WITH A GROAN THE SAILOR HAD ONLY HEARD THE LAST WORDS UTTERED BY THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0010 NO PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING NO HE IS NOT DEAD HIS PULSE STILL BEATS HE HAS EVEN UTTERED A MOAN BUT FOR YOUR BOY'S SAKE CALM YOURSELF WE HAVE NEED OF ALL OUR SELF POSSESSION DO NOT MAKE US LOSE IT MY FRIEND
6529-62556-0011 PENCROFT WAS SILENT BUT A REACTION SET IN AND GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS IN THE MEANWHILE GIDEON SPILETT ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT HIS IDEAS AND PROCEED METHODICALLY AFTER HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE BALL
6529-62556-0012 ENTERING IN FRONT BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH RIBS HAD ISSUED BEHIND BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH BUT WHAT MISCHIEF HAD THE BALL COMMITTED IN ITS PASSAGE WHAT IMPORTANT ORGANS HAD BEEN REACHED A PROFESSIONAL SURGEON WOULD HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THIS AT ONCE
6529-62556-0013 AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
6529-62556-0014 NOW WHAT STYPTICS WHAT ANTIPHLOGISTICS OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED BY WHAT MEANS COULD INFLAMMATION BE PREVENTED AT ANY RATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT DELAY
6529-62556-0015 IT DID NOT APPEAR NECESSARY TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT A FRESH FLOW OF BLOOD SHOULD BE CAUSED BY BATHING THEM IN TEPID WATER AND COMPRESSING THEIR LIPS THE HEMORRHAGE HAD BEEN VERY ABUNDANT AND HERBERT WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY THE LOSS OF BLOOD
6529-62556-0016 THE REPORTER THEREFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SIMPLY BATHE THE TWO WOUNDS WITH COLD WATER HERBERT WAS PLACED ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND WAS MAINTAINED IN THAT POSITION HE MUST NOT BE MOVED SAID GIDEON SPILETT
6529-62556-0017 HE IS IN THE MOST FAVORABLE POSITION FOR THE WOUNDS IN HIS BACK AND CHEST TO SUPPURATE EASILY AND ABSOLUTE REST IS NECESSARY WHAT CAN'T WE CARRY HIM TO GRANITE HOUSE ASKED PENCROFT NO PENCROFT REPLIED THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0018 CYRUS SAID HE I AM NOT A SURGEON I AM IN TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY YOU MUST AID ME WITH YOUR ADVICE YOUR EXPERIENCE TAKE COURAGE MY FRIEND ANSWERED THE ENGINEER PRESSING THE REPORTER'S HAND JUDGE COOLLY
6529-62556-0019 THINK ONLY OF THIS HERBERT MUST BE SAVED THESE WORDS RESTORED TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT SELF POSSESSION WHICH HE HAD LOST IN A MOMENT OF DISCOURAGEMENT ON FEELING HIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY HE SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE BED CYRUS HARDING STOOD NEAR
6529-62556-0020 PENCROFT HAD TORN UP HIS SHIRT AND WAS MECHANICALLY MAKING LINT SPILETT THEN EXPLAINED TO CYRUS HARDING THAT HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT FIRST OF ALL TO STOP THE HEMORRHAGE BUT NOT CLOSE THE TWO WOUNDS OR CAUSE THEIR IMMEDIATE CICATRIZATION FOR THERE HAD BEEN INTERNAL PERFORATION
6529-62556-0021 AND THE SUPPURATION MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO ACCUMULATE IN THE CHEST HARDING APPROVED ENTIRELY AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO CLOSE THEM BY IMMEDIATE COAPTATION AND NOW
6529-62556-0022 DID THE COLONISTS POSSESS AN EFFICACIOUS AGENT TO ACT AGAINST THE INFLAMMATION WHICH MIGHT OCCUR YES THEY HAD ONE FOR NATURE HAD GENEROUSLY LAVISHED IT THEY HAD COLD WATER THAT IS TO SAY THE MOST POWERFUL SEDATIVE THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED AGAINST INFLAMMATION OF WOUNDS
6529-62556-0023 THE MOST EFFICACIOUS THERAPEUTIC AGENT IN GRAVE CASES AND THE ONE WHICH IS NOW ADOPTED BY ALL PHYSICIANS COLD WATER HAS MOREOVER THE ADVANTAGE OF LEAVING THE WOUND IN ABSOLUTE REST AND PRESERVING IT FROM ALL PREMATURE DRESSING A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE
6529-62556-0024 SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT CONTACT WITH THE AIR IS DANGEROUS DURING THE FIRST DAYS GIDEON SPILETT AND CYRUS HARDING REASONED THUS WITH THEIR SIMPLE GOOD SENSE AND THEY ACTED AS THE BEST SURGEON WOULD HAVE DONE
6529-62556-0025 COMPRESSES OF LINEN WERE APPLIED TO POOR HERBERT'S TWO WOUNDS AND WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY WET WITH COLD WATER THE SAILOR HAD AT FIRST LIGHTED A FIRE IN THE HUT WHICH WAS NOT WANTING IN THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE MAPLE SUGAR MEDICINAL PLANTS
6529-62556-0026 THE SAME WHICH THE LAD HAD GATHERED ON THE BANKS OF LAKE GRANT ENABLED THEM TO MAKE SOME REFRESHING DRINKS WHICH THEY GAVE HIM WITHOUT HIS TAKING ANY NOTICE OF IT HIS FEVER WAS EXTREMELY HIGH AND ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT HIS BECOMING CONSCIOUS
6529-62556-0027 HERBERT'S LIFE HUNG ON A THREAD AND THIS THREAD MIGHT BREAK AT ANY MOMENT THE NEXT DAY THE TWELFTH OF NOVEMBER THE HOPES OF HARDING AND HIS COMPANIONS SLIGHTLY REVIVED HERBERT HAD COME OUT OF HIS LONG STUPOR HE OPENED HIS EYES HE RECOGNIZED CYRUS HARDING
6529-62556-0028 THE REPORTER AND PENCROFT HE UTTERED TWO OR THREE WORDS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY TOLD HIM AND SPILETT BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN PERFECTLY STILL TELLING HIM THAT HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER AND THAT HIS WOUNDS WOULD HEAL IN A FEW DAYS
6529-62556-0029 HOWEVER HERBERT SCARCELY SUFFERED AT ALL AND THE COLD WATER WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONSTANTLY BATHED PREVENTED ANY INFLAMMATION OF THE WOUNDS THE SUPPURATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN A REGULAR WAY THE FEVER DID NOT INCREASE
6529-62556-0030 AND IT MIGHT NOW BE HOPED THAT THIS TERRIBLE WOUND WOULD NOT INVOLVE ANY CATASTROPHE PENCROFT FELT THE SWELLING OF HIS HEART GRADUALLY SUBSIDE HE WAS LIKE A SISTER OF MERCY LIKE A MOTHER BY THE BED OF HER CHILD
6529-62556-0031 HERBERT DOZED AGAIN BUT HIS SLEEP APPEARED MORE NATURAL TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU HOPE MISTER SPILETT SAID PENCROFT TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU WILL SAVE HERBERT YES WE WILL SAVE HIM REPLIED THE REPORTER THE WOUND IS SERIOUS AND PERHAPS
6529-62556-0032 EVEN THE BALL HAS TRAVERSED THE LUNGS BUT THE PERFORATION OF THIS ORGAN IS NOT FATAL GOD BLESS YOU ANSWERED PENCROFT AS MAY BE BELIEVED DURING THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CORRAL THE COLONISTS HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF NURSING HERBERT
6529-62556-0033 THEY DID NOT THINK EITHER OF THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEM SHOULD THE CONVICTS RETURN OR OF THE PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN FOR THE FUTURE BUT ON THIS DAY WHILE PENCROFT WATCHED BY THE SICK BED CYRUS HARDING AND THE REPORTER CONSULTED AS TO WHAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO DO
6529-62556-0034 AT THE MOMENT HE SCALED THE PALISADE HAD CLEARLY SEEN SOME ONE OF THE CONVICTS RUNNING ALONG THE SOUTHERN SPUR OF MOUNT FRANKLIN TOWARDS WHOM TOP HAD SPRUNG IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE OBJECT HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY DEFEATED BY THE ROCKS AT THE MOUTH OF THE MERCY
6529-62556-0035 AND AS HE WAS A MAN TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE BEEN OVERPOWERED YES THAT IS TO BE FEARED SAID THE REPORTER THEN DOUBTLESS THE CONVICTS INSTALLED THEMSELVES IN THE CORRAL WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF EVERYTHING AND ONLY FLED WHEN THEY SAW US COMING
6529-62556-0036 IT IS VERY EVIDENT TOO THAT AT THIS MOMENT AYRTON WHETHER LIVING OR DEAD IS NOT HERE WE SHALL HAVE TO BEAT THE FOREST SAID THE ENGINEER AND RID THE ISLAND OF THESE WRETCHES PENCROFT'S PRESENTIMENTS WERE NOT MISTAKEN WHEN HE WISHED TO HUNT THEM AS WILD BEASTS
6529-62556-0037 THAT WOULD HAVE SPARED US ALL THESE MISFORTUNES YES ANSWERED THE REPORTER BUT NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MERCILESS AT ANY RATE SAID THE ENGINEER WE ARE OBLIGED TO WAIT SOME TIME AND TO REMAIN AT THE CORRAL UNTIL WE CAN CARRY HERBERT WITHOUT DANGER TO GRANITE HOUSE
6529-62556-0038 HE MUST NOT COME RETURNED CYRUS HARDING QUICKLY HE WOULD BE MURDERED ON THE ROAD IT IS VERY PROBABLE HOWEVER THAT HE WILL ATTEMPT TO REJOIN US AH IF THE TELEGRAPH STILL ACTED HE MIGHT BE WARNED BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOW
6529-62556-0039 AS TO LEAVING PENCROFT AND HERBERT HERE ALONE WE COULD NOT DO IT WELL I WILL GO ALONE TO GRANITE HOUSE NO NO CYRUS ANSWERED THE REPORTER YOU MUST NOT EXPOSE YOURSELF YOUR COURAGE WOULD BE OF NO AVAIL THE VILLAINS ARE EVIDENTLY WATCHING THE CORRAL
6529-62556-0040 THEY ARE HIDDEN IN THE THICK WOODS WHICH SURROUND IT AND IF YOU GO WE SHALL SOON HAVE TO REGRET TWO MISFORTUNES INSTEAD OF ONE
6529-62556-0041 IT IS NOW FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS SINCE HE HAS HAD ANY NEWS OF US HE WILL BE SURE TO COME AND AS HE WILL BE LESS ON HIS GUARD THAN WE SHOULD BE OURSELVES ADDED SPILETT HE WILL BE KILLED IS THERE REALLY NO WAY OF WARNING HIM
6529-62556-0042 WHO HAD UNDERSTOOD THE ENGINEER TOP CAN GO WHERE WE CANNOT HE WILL CARRY TO GRANITE HOUSE THE NEWS OF THE CORRAL AND HE WILL BRING BACK TO US THAT FROM GRANITE HOUSE QUICK SAID HARDING QUICK SPILETT RAPIDLY TORE A LEAF FROM HIS NOTE BOOK AND WROTE THESE WORDS
6529-62556-0043 HERBERT WOUNDED WE ARE AT THE CORRAL BE ON YOUR GUARD DO NOT LEAVE GRANITE HOUSE HAVE THE CONVICTS APPEARED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD REPLY BY TOP
6529-62556-0044 GO GO TOP BOUNDED AT THESE WORDS HE UNDERSTOOD HE KNEW WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM THE ROAD TO THE CORRAL WAS FAMILIAR TO HIM
6529-62556-0045 TOP RUNNING AMONG THE GRASS OR IN THE WOOD WOULD PASS UNPERCEIVED THE ENGINEER WENT TO THE GATE OF THE CORRAL AND OPENED IT
6529-62556-0046 TOP SPRANG FORWARDS THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED HE WILL GET THERE SAID THE REPORTER YES AND HE WILL COME BACK THE FAITHFUL ANIMAL WHAT O'CLOCK IS IT ASKED GIDEON SPILETT TEN
6529-62556-0047 IN AN HOUR HE MAY BE HERE WE WILL WATCH FOR HIS RETURN THE GATE OF THE CORRAL WAS CLOSED THE ENGINEER AND THE REPORTER RE ENTERED THE HOUSE HERBERT WAS STILL IN A SLEEP PENCROFT KEPT THE COMPRESSES ALWAYS WET SPILETT
6529-62556-0048 SEEING THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO AT THAT MOMENT BUSIED HIMSELF IN PREPARING SOME NOURISHMENT WHILE ATTENTIVELY WATCHING THAT PART OF THE ENCLOSURE AGAINST THE HILL AT WHICH AN ATTACK MIGHT BE EXPECTED THE SETTLERS AWAITED TOP'S RETURN WITH MUCH ANXIETY
6529-62556-0049 A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK CYRUS HARDING AND THE REPORTER RIFLE IN HAND WERE BEHIND THE GATE READY TO OPEN IT AT THE FIRST BARK OF THEIR DOG THEY DID NOT DOUBT THAT IF TOP HAD ARRIVED SAFELY AT GRANITE HOUSE
