8063-274112-0000 AND EXCEEDINGLY UNHAPPY IN FACT D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN WE SAY FOR WE MUST CALL HIM BY HIS NAME TO REMIND OUR READERS OF HIS EXISTENCE D'ARTAGNAN WE REPEAT
8063-274112-0001 HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO AMIDST THESE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES OF FASHION AFTER FOLLOWING THE KING DURING TWO WHOLE DAYS AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0002 THE MUSKETEER FELT THAT HE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS TO SATISFY THE CRAVINGS OF HIS NATURE AT EVERY MOMENT ASSAILED BY PEOPLE ASKING HIM HOW DO YOU THINK THIS COSTUME SUITS ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN QUIET SARCASTIC TONES
8063-274112-0003 WHY I THINK YOU ARE QUITE AS WELL DRESSED AS THE
8063-274112-0004 IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
8063-274112-0005 WHENEVER ANY ONE ASKED HIM HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DRESS YOURSELF THIS EVENING HE REPLIED I SHALL UNDRESS MYSELF AT WHICH THE LADIES ALL LAUGHED
8063-274112-0006 AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
8063-274112-0007 QUITE EXHAUSTED FROM DANCING YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN INQUIRED THE KING WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT
8063-274112-0008 ANY ONE WHO HAD THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR OF BEING NEAR HIM COULD WISH TO LEAVE HIM SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0009 AH IF I COULD ONLY HOLD THE BALANCING POLE WHILE YOU WERE DANCING IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN SAID THE KING GRAVELY PEOPLE DANCE WITHOUT BALANCING POLES
8063-274112-0010 AH INDEED SAID THE MUSKETEER CONTINUING HIS IMPERCEPTIBLE TONE OF IRONY
8063-274112-0011 THEREFORE AT FONTAINEBLEAU FOR TO DO SO WOULD BE USELESS BUT WITH THE PERMISSION OF OUR READERS FOLLOW HIM TO THE RUE DES LOMBARDS WHERE HE WAS LOCATED AT THE SIGN OF THE PILON D'OR
8063-274112-0012 AND THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY WARM THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW OPEN AND THAT ONE BELONGING TO A ROOM
8063-274112-0013 A PERFUME OF SPICES MINGLED WITH ANOTHER PERFUME LESS EXOTIC BUT MORE PENETRATING NAMELY THAT WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET ASCENDED TO SALUTE THE NOSTRILS OF THE MUSKETEER D'ARTAGNAN RECLINING IN AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIR WITH HIS LEGS NOT STRETCHED OUT
8063-274112-0014 BUT SIMPLY PLACED UPON A STOOL FORMED AN ANGLE OF THE MOST OBTUSE FORM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SEEN BOTH HIS ARMS WERE CROSSED OVER HIS HEAD HIS HEAD RECLINING UPON HIS LEFT SHOULDER LIKE ALEXANDER THE GREAT HIS EYES
8063-274112-0015 USUALLY SO QUICK AND INTELLIGENT IN THEIR EXPRESSION WERE NOW HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED FASTENED AS IT WERE UPON A SMALL CORNER OF BLUE SKY THAT WAS VISIBLE BEHIND THE OPENING OF THE CHIMNEYS
8063-274112-0016 THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH BLUE AND NO MORE TO FILL ONE OF THE SACKS OF LENTILS OR HARICOTS WHICH FORMED THE PRINCIPAL FURNITURE OF THE SHOP ON THE GROUND FLOOR THUS EXTENDED AT HIS EASE AND SHELTERED IN HIS PLACE OF OBSERVATION BEHIND THE WINDOW D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0017 SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
8063-274112-0018 WHILE THE WINDOWS OF THE UPPER APARTMENTS WERE BEING CLOSED AND THE RHYTHMIC STEPS OF A PATROL OF SOLDIERS FORMING THE NIGHT WATCH COULD BE HEARD RETREATING D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED HOWEVER TO THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT THE BLUE CORNER OF THE SKY A FEW PACES FROM HIM
8063-274112-0019 AND HIS EYES FIXED ON D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS EITHER THINKING DREAMING OR SLEEPING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
8063-274112-0020 BUT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT STIR
8063-274112-0021 AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
8063-274112-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE NOISE PRODUCED BY PLANCHET'S FALL D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE HEARD MANY OTHER AND VERY DIFFERENT FALLS DID NOT APPEAR TO PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT ONE BESIDES
8063-274112-0023 AND YET PLANCHET FANCIED THAT IN TOKEN OF TACIT APPROVAL HE SAW HIM IMPERCEPTIBLY SMILE AT THE WORD STUPID THIS EMBOLDENED HIM TO SAY ARE YOU ASLEEP MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN NO PLANCHET I AM NOT EVEN ASLEEP REPLIED THE MUSKETEER
8063-274112-0024 I AM IN DESPAIR SAID PLANCHET TO HEAR SUCH A WORD AS EVEN WELL
8063-274112-0025 OF COURSE MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WELL WELL THEN THE WORD DISTRESSES ME BEYOND MEASURE TELL ME WHY YOU ARE DISTRESSED PLANCHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN ASLEEP
8063-274112-0026 PLANCHET YOU KNOW THAT I AM NEVER BORED EXCEPT TO DAY AND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BAH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN IT IS A WEEK SINCE YOU RETURNED HERE FROM FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0027 IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NO LONGER YOUR ORDERS TO ISSUE OR YOUR MEN TO REVIEW AND MANEUVER YOU NEED THE SOUND OF GUNS DRUMS AND ALL THAT DIN AND CONFUSION
8063-274112-0028 WHEN YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE BOTH WERE THERE A CERTAIN ARAB
8063-274112-0029 HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW ALTHOUGH OF A VERY ODD COMPLEXION WHICH WAS THE SAME COLOR AS YOUR OLIVES WELL THIS ARAB WHENEVER HE HAD DONE EATING OR WORKING USED TO SIT DOWN TO REST HIMSELF
8063-274112-0030 AS I AM RESTING MYSELF NOW AND SMOKED I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF MAGICAL LEAVES IN A LARGE AMBER MOUTHED TUBE
8063-274112-0031 BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP TO LIE DOWN THAN TO SIT DOWN TO BE DEAD THAN TO LIE DOWN HE WAS AN ACUTELY MELANCHOLY ARAB AND I REMEMBER HIM PERFECTLY WELL
8063-274112-0032 HE USED TO CUT OFF THE HEADS OF PROTESTANTS WITH THE MOST SINGULAR GUSTO PRECISELY AND THEN USED TO EMBALM THEM WHEN THEY WERE WORTH THE TROUBLE
8063-274112-0033 HE LOOKED LIKE A BASKET MAKER MAKING BASKETS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT PLANCHET HE DID
8063-274112-0034 I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS MODE OF REASONING
8063-274112-0035 IN POINT OF FACT THEN BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP IS PLAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE MAY BE FATIGUED AND PLANCHET SMILED IN A ROGUISH WAY AS FOR BETTER TO BE LYING DOWN LET THAT PASS
8063-274112-0036 IT IS IN MY OPINION VERY ABSURD MY OWN UNDOUBTED PREFERENCE BEING FOR MY BED AND IF YOU ARE NOT OF MY OPINION IT IS SIMPLY AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF TELLING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING YOURSELF TO DEATH PLANCHET
8063-274112-0037 EXACTLY WELL THEN I AM LIKE HIS HARE HE HAS GOT A HARE ALSO THEN HE HAS ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS WELL WHAT DOES HIS HARE DO THEN
8063-274112-0038 THINKS AH
8063-274112-0039 AND YET MONSIEUR YOU HAVE A LOOK OUT UPON THE STREET YES AND WONDERFULLY INTERESTING THAT IS OF COURSE BUT IT IS NO LESS TRUE MONSIEUR THAT
8063-274112-0040 AH PLANCHET MY FRIEND RETURNED D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE GETTING AMBITIOUS
